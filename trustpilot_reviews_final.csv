Stanley Ho,Microsoft make a FRAUD to the customer,"Please let me know how to make a complaint to Microsoft M365 service.  I believed they tricked the customer to use their new M365 with AI feature although they have switching option to a classic edition.  Microsoft is a giant company but they have no channel let the customer make a complaint.  I hope you guys provide a channel I want to make a complaint to the Microsoft who made the problem and not compensate my package.  Only apologize to stop the case.  On the other hand, their support agent not commit to reply all my request.  They always make a lie to the customer not willing to follow up the problem they created the trouble to customer.  Over the world, is it make sense to the customer?",1,2025-04-28T00:31:55.000Z

Layla,Will take money from your account but can’t find out why,I recent had money taken from my account of which I am confused about a so have no active subscriptionIt is incredibly hard to get through to anyone at Microsoft and those I have spoken to have no idea how to help.You would think a company of this size and technology capabilities would be able to search for a customer via their name or via the bank account they have taken money fromAs zero resolution I have had to block all payments to Microsoft for the foreseeable to ensure this doesn’t occur again.,1,2025-04-23T22:23:20.000Z
Adrian,Useless in terms of account recovery,"DO NOT MAKE OUTLOOK YOUR MAIN EMAIL INBOX! I had my microsoft account of almost 10 years hacked last october and I have fought with microsoft support for months to try and recover it however every time i try to contact them about my case they ask me to provide a lot of information to prove that the account is mine which I do and they say to wait up to 10 business days for them to get back which they never do so i start a new support form explaining what happened and i'm stuck in the same loophole, I even tried the Xbox Department about it as that account was mainly used for Minecraft and Professional Emails but even they were completely useless, absolutely useless company and DO NOT TRUST THEM with your personal data and making it your main email source...",1,2025-04-19T21:19:51.000Z
Jamie P,Pro in July 2024,"Pro in July 2024, which began crashing within days. Despite paying for premium support, Microsoft completely failed to deliver even the most basic service. Support ignored emails, sent my device to the wrong repair centre, and returned it to me unrepaired just days before a crucial work trip — leaving me to source and fund a replacement myself. Multiple agents promised urgent help, none followed through. I’ve wasted hours chasing incompetent staff, been left out of pocket, and am still without a working device. Microsoft has shown zero accountability, empathy, or respect for my time and money. This has been, hands down, the worst customer service experience I’ve ever had.",1,2025-04-17T21:25:04.000Z

Jav EBRA,How poor support ruins the reputation…,"How poor support ruins the reputation of a company and converts a gentle customer from saying please politely to saying the most insulting words towards the supplier!I am very disappointed with the support I get from Microsoft.Seeking help over a week and no reults!I was using Windows 365 2vCPU 8G 128. I want to upgrade to W365 4vCPU 16G 128G, which I bought and I paid for it.Currently it does not allow me to assign the license to my MS ID.I am an IT Person and I know that such a fix can be done in a minute. What is wrong over there? It is so upsetting and frustrating to pay for a service and not getting it. And when you ask support it is a cycle of having no result.I basically want to move to my new purchase W365 4vCPU 16G 128G and then stop the old one W365 2vCPU 8G 128. Which part of this is difficult for you to understand that I am begging for support over a week and I get nothing!What a shame!",1,2025-04-14T08:12:44.000Z
Adriana Britton,Incompetent or liers,"Incompetent or liers.Cancelled a business 365, after having spent about 2 hours on calls with support. I received an email confirming closure of the account and advising we wouldn't be charged further.Microsoft are still trying to take payments, attempting 24 times now since they confirmed the account was closed and said no more payments were due. We are now facing bank charges for their multiple attempts to take money they said they wouldn't.Avoid Microsoft at all costs. Either they are incompetent, and cannot close an account, even though they said and confirmed by email that they had, or they lied and said they'd done something they hadn't just to be able to close the call.Either way, not a company you'd want to do business with.",1,2025-04-12T11:30:14.000Z
DKBurrell,Customer Service,"The first time I spoke with the representative was very pleasant. She refunded one charge. However, since the day we spoke, Microsoft charged my account excessively exceeding the amount of fees I should have paid. I am a senior living on a fixed income, therefore, every dollar counts. I attempted to contact them an estimated 5 times, however, the computer terminated each call without resolving the problem. Therefore, I cannot retrieve the fees I am entitled to receive. Consequently, I have been charged excess fees without resolution. I am extremely unhappy with this service and will find alternatives to using any of their products in the future.",1,2025-04-10T18:17:00.000Z

Zee Leiper,Microsoft juggled my case for a month and told me I can't have my account back.,"A month ago I was hacked and nearly lost every account tied to gaming that I have. It took me a week to recover all but my microsoft account.I spent the last month trying to get my case to get my account back only to have gotten it escalated 2 days ago.Today I received an email informing me that nothing can be done to change my emails back because of some stupid policy. Apparently when a security function (including passwords, emails, phone numbers, etc) is changed, support is not authorized to revert any changes done.As a result they suspended my account permanently, to avoid further use by the thief of my account. So after a month of being juggled by the first level of support I was told, after what was probably a short glance at my case, that nothing can be done and I've lost my minecraft forever. I can never again interact with the pets I have in my worlds, even if I bought a new minecraft. So thanks for nothing microsoft.If by some chance someone who has likely been getting scams in their minecraft server from a guy that goes by ""Dyndyss,"" that is my account that has been taken over by some russian hacker. I apologize if they have inconvenienced you.",1,2025-04-08T21:25:40.000Z
Jon,Microsoft MS 365 and Office customer…,"Microsoft MS 365 and Office customer support is HORRIBLE - like going to DMV. Why can't Microsoft get this portion of user experience right. They just build a maze of ""AI Co-Pilot"" suggestions that don't work, just frustrate.

Even when you write to their head office in Reading, they can’t be arsed to write back to you but pass you onto their customer service operatives in India.There is a reason that Microsoft consistently receive negative feedback for their customer service. They don’t give a shit about us.I consistently receive excellent customer service in the UK from health care providers, banks and supermarkets.Microsoft has eliminated all human support. If you want your complaint to be handled by a bot, hand over your money to Microsoft. If not, take your business elsewhere.",1,2025-04-05T14:26:38.000Z

Bill,Microsoft locks me out of my hotmail…,"Microsoft locks me out of my hotmail accounts whenever I log in from an alternate device and/or location, has a flawed recovery system that locks you out of alternate email accounts on file to receive a code, and thus denies the customer from receiving vital MEDICAL, Business, Financial, and Social information. This becomes like a wrecking ball to a customer's career, emotions and even life in general. Even after I put in the correct username, password, captcha and puzzle solutions all immediately, Microsoft still doesn't believe it is me. I spoke to several reps by phone and got shocking responses about the ""process"" which is totally flawed and against the customer.Further - and this could be illegal - when Microsoft takes advertisers' money to reach target market customers, but does not allow the customers to access those ads, promotions, etc., then Microsoft OWES THOSE ADVERTISERS A REFUND!!! Microsoft also does not allow even its own supervisors to escalate very legitimate concerns such as these, and thus is dictatorial, disrespectful, and demeaning to its customers, advertisers and employees.I suggested several viable resolutions to the company and it politely refused. This ""extra security and protection"" on hotmail accounts should be an opt-in not a one-size-fits-all mandate with no opt-out potential.Government regulators overseeing the industry should investigate Microsoft's practices and behaviors up to and including redoing the hotmail policy, refunding advertisers monies, and stripping Microsoft of its license to operate. Class-action suits should be considered as well.Just look at all the complaints and pathetically low ratings online about this egregious behavior, how disgusting! Also, the company supervisor did not call me back for two scheduled calls (one finally did). Add arrogance to this complaint, too. Do not trust Microsoft or buy anything from it.",1,2025-06-11T21:30:46.000Z

Their job is merely to take your information and forward you to the next queue that will no resolve issue and forward you to another queue.  Each person takes your contact information as if for the first time even though you have a ticket number.

Diane Paul,Appalling customer service,"Appalling customer service. Have gone round and round in circles for two days trying to sign in to the Teams site that have taken over from Skype who I have never had any problems with as it should be straightforward to log in. No way of changing my email address to my new one. I put my old email in, they refuse to accept my password. I ask for a code, it either doesn't arrive or when it does they reject it. Over and over. I look for the code, which means I leave the page to find their email and when I return, the page has disappeared and I have to begin again. And again...etc. I am absolutely appalled at their service and consequently I am not going to use Teams as I have found another way of reaching my students and it isn't Microsoft.

Cancelled on time but I dont have right on it! If I cancel the subscription 3 days after activating it its IMPLICIT that i dont want to pay for it. Or there is no free trial or its a fraud.

TonyZ,Stop being greedy over Office update charges,"I appreciate that maintaining support for old systems is expensive. I have known about the need to update from Windows 10 to Windows 11 for some time, the update is free and I have update plans in place.I only recently heard of the need to update Office Home 2019. Investigating, it seems that the preferred route is subscription to Office 365 Home. The single purchase option only covers a single system, whereas my previous single purchase of Office covered at least 2 systems (which I need). I could find no discount offered for multiple purchases. I need security updates and bug fixes. I do not want or need new features provided by the subscription service.

I reconnected with Microsoft Support the app sent me a link to a third party contractor who charges for their support just to find out that Outlook is having a major outage.

No one takes ownership, and no progress is made. The situation remains unresolved and is directly affecting my business operations.I’ve asked repeatedly to escalate the issue. Still, no manager has contacted me, despite requesting urgent contact before 17:00 UK time. The process is disjointed, dismissive, and completely unfit for purpose—especially for business users who rely on Microsoft’s services.Microsoft, your systems have failed me.

Bruno Tereso,Extremely Frustrating and Ineffective Customer Support Experience,"I never imagined that a company as large and well-resourced as Microsoft would have such poor and inaccessible customer support.My main Microsoft account and my security email were both blocked simultaneously without warning, and without any evidence of suspicious activity (as later confirmed by Microsoft themselves). This left me locked out of my personal and professional data, with no recovery option, since even the backup account was also blocked.What followed was a Kafkaesque loop of filling out the same online form at least four times, always met with silence or vague automated replies. At one point, I was asked to provide highly sensitive personal information, including billing name, credit card details (last 4 digits), and postal code — without proper justification, which raises serious data protection concerns.Worst of all, there is no phone number to call, no clear escalation process, and no real human interaction. I spent hours on their chat support, only to get repetitive, unhelpful responses that ignored my direct questions.Even after Microsoft confirmed that no unauthorized access had occurred, they continued to block my account and demanded that I repeat the same process again. It’s been over two weeks and still no resolution, no explanation, and no accountability.This is not just bad customer service — it's disrespectful, opaque, and borders on negligence. A company handling essential communication tools like email should be far more transparent, responsive, and secure in their support systems.",1,2025-03-27T12:39:58.000Z

The agent stuck to basic troubleshooting I’d already exhausted, offering little insight beyond spotting a forgotten Exchange account from an old job. Microsoft’s solution? Create a new profile and export all 7 accounts’ data, a tedious workaround I rejected. When I called it what it was – a workaround – the agent got defensive. Frustrated, I wished them a nice evening and ended the call.Ironically, we found the fix in Microsoft’s own helpfiles: adding DisableOffice365SimplifiedAccountCreation to the registry. This resolved the issue instantly, no thanks to support.Microsoft support’s lack of depth and refusal to escalate forced us to solve it ourselves.

During the latter part of 2024 I started getting messages informing that my subscription was expiring, I then set about renewing and I have had a terrible time told to try again. Then I again had a message telling me to renew, I looked up on my bank and found that December 24 and January 25 I had paid so, I went on to ""live Chat"" some considerable time later I talked to a support person. My information that I had paid in December and January fell on deaf ears and I was told the only solution was to buy a lifetime subscription at £119.99 faced with loosing years of history, I was then cut off but eventually received a call back. Without a credible result and loosing the will to live I agreed and handed over my debit card details and paid the £119.99......I just seem to be getting no where and on shutting down and re-starting and the saga continued... and I am still getting messages that inform me I have not renewed my subscription....I have to get back onto Microsoft which history demonstrates is either a long long wait or fruitless attempt....help Microsoft!

Smeets,subscriber to MS 365 fraud by Micrsoft,"subscriber to MS 365 on November (have been using office since 1990) 3 days later microsoft system told me to resubscribe as my subscription was expired. A few days later MS deducted 39.99 from my account for Xbox. We have no Xbox and we never had one, ~reported the matter to Microsoft via telephone to Iris and she promised a solution within 24 hours, never heard from her again. Emailed Microsoft who in resume find all kinds of excuses not to correct the matter. Not only did it deduct unauthorized amount from my account but blocked my 365 subscription for fraud (although it was MS who committed the fraud) . So we can no longer use the features. MS must be in pretty bad shape to result in such trivial unlawful tactics. We have filed an official complaint with the court in belgium and the European union.We warn everyone to hand over confidential financial information to, Microsoft and make sure to use a debit card with just  the right amount of money allocated  for the subscription.In addition we would like to add some of the people who claim to resolve your issue are not real and are simply robots. Further forcing a person to use MS email service to use MS 365 is against European law and simply abusing your confidential financial information and deducting unauthorized money from your account is illegal. There are other good working alternatives toMS 365 and a company and the executives who lack integrity honesty and decency cannot be trusted and their products should be avoided.

Only basic rensponses from support “engineer”. Every time there is same copy/paste email response, asking for appropriet time to call but then he do not call.That is all that Microsoft support is - endless loop of useless emails.Noone to call, no manager to raise your concern to.

Nicholas Ashley,BE AWARE THAT MICROSOFT HAS AXED VITAL SUPPORT,"Just be aware that if you have a problem with whatever version of Microsoft Windows/Office that you have, you will have an uphill struggle to get help. THEY NO LONGER HAVE A MANNED TELEPHONE NUMBER IN THE UK! AND THEIR IA DRIVEN HELP IS MORE THAN USELSS.2 days ago, I uploaded a Microsoft 365 update. Later, when I tried to open a password protected Word Doc., it had erased my password!! This was strange as I absolutely knew what my passwords were. On investigation. I discovered that the same thing had happened TO ALL my MS Word & Excel Docs!! THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT LABOUR INTENSIVE DOCUMENTS - I CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THEM!! I had spent two weeks working on them.To solve the problem I then used the UK 0334 800 2400 number & was taken to a useless, totally inadequate AI program, which led me into a dead end every time! I have also phoned the UK 0800  041 8773 number countless times -- with NO ONE ANSWERING -- it just rings and rings or abruptly cuts off!! VERY FRUSTRATING! The MS Support program was just as useless and the Microsoft Community, besides being unhelpful, contained responses that were sarcastic and blatantly aggressive -- making it sound like it was my fault!! I have no control over what updates Microsoft uploads. I, possibly erroneously, supposed that whatever is being uploaded is benign.I have used Windows since 1994 & supported the company for 30 years -- I DON'T DESERVED TO BE TREATED LIKE THIS!. So disappointed in Microsoft. IT IS BECAUSE OF THEIR UPGRAD THAT I AM IN THIS SITUATION AND THEY HAVE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM THEY CREATED.What I need is a MS technician to help me solve this problem by Remote Control -- using my Laptop camera and showing my Passport to confirm my true identity. They could also use 2-step verification to prove I am not a Hacker/Scammer. They use to do Remote Control in the past, why have they stopped it? Bad move MS.The security of my Docs mean everything to me, as it should to Microsoft -- but it is obvious they are not, otherwise they would have a telephone number that actually gets you through to a real person.",1,2025-03-04T21:11:17.000Z

They offer you the ""service"" of putting in a report and then they call you at their convenience (if they call at all) and setup appointments that they do not honor or call at. I have spoken to several reps at this point whenever they get around to it - none of which have solved my outlook issue sycing with my AWS email domain. They are experts in theory, but have not been able to fix my issue nor have they spent ample time to try. I've had them hang up knowing that I can't contact them after.

I could not understand her at all, I am an english speaking individual and could barly understand her when speaking to me explaining the problem.2) On the 24th she mentioned that she was going to reset my MFA and I would be able to login by tonight, she also mentioned she would send me an email. I received zero email or communication responses she did not reset anything.3.) I called into the 18008659408 to complain again that I had still not been able to access my account after 5 days. She then called me the morning for the 27th to say that it was reset. Magically everything was working. My issue is that she makes false promises to customers and does not follow up on it or do what she says she is going to do. This has resulted my entire business email to be down for 5+ days.4.)Additioanlly to this she called me on 2 occassions and I told her to call me back in 15min so I could get to a better place to take the call. No call backs after confirming on two occasions she would call back.5.)How does it take 5 days to sort out a MFA issue, my business has been offline from emails for 5 days because of this.6.)The support numbers dont help at all, none of the commercial business support numbers can assist me with this issue on the phone, every single one of them arranged for a call back the next day. This is a major issue becuase the person who is supposed to be arranged for the call back has no urgency.7.)If the technician cant call me why cant they just send an email - I asked 3 times to change my primary source of contact to be set to email instead of phone call after eventually giving up that the call would resolve anything.This whole situation has put an extreamly bad taste in my mouth - I do not ever leave reviews but I have gone out my way to write this review with how bad the service and support has been.MFA taking 5+ days to resolve ?",1,2025-02-27T19:02:22.000Z

They kept giving me the run around I had to contact them 6 times for a subscription problem it came as an alert on my account that I needed to manage my subscription.  It had recurring on it but the Microsoft customer service person told me to repurchase a subscription. But when I would check it was saying my next payment was coming out at the time it was suppose too .   I did repurchase but it still was coming up with a red triangle that I needed to manage my subscription after numerous online chats and phone calls and them having me waiting around with some of the customer service people just jerking me around then . I swear they were taking breaks .  And one agent was basically telling me to hurry up and then jerked me around .  Sent me a link to send the picture but of course it didn’t send kept me waiting .. took my number but never called me .1 week after I got the subscription again it had a yellow triangle on my account with an exclamation sign in the yellow triangle and they made me try to send a picture of it ?? I’m not sure why I need to send a picture of it when it wasn’t that hard to imagine a yellow triangle with an exclamation sign .  How did they not know what it meant and jerked me around made me wait long periods of time in between the chats then they  told me I needed to contact someone else ?  After over half an hour without them telling me nothing .  When I checked Google search it said that I needed to update my app so I updated my app and the problem seemed to go away .  Your telling me with a simple request they couldn’t help me and jerked me around for days .  I guess when your being harassed by the police this is what happens your not getting service so they can delete my evidence like Apple has done with my evidence .  Watch the triangle  come up again just because I complained and so they can delete my evidence against the police .,1,2025-02-20T23:10:38.000Z

A person review never changes the original decision when it could just not like the word black or ethnic and you could be talking about beans, not race, 4) Their products don't work seamlessly, especially if you own the office software with many glitches and bugs particularly MS Outlook.  They want you to sign in to use a hardcopy of MS Word, with constant error message how you don't have permission to save.  And you have to play games to get it to work (extra steps).

Hocine,I’ve been trying to get in touch with…,"I’ve been trying to get in touch with Microsoft Support for over a week now, and it has been an incredibly frustrating experience. I’ve attempted to use the recovery form multiple times to regain access to my account, but unfortunately, I haven’t had any success.I did receive an email from Microsoft stating, ""We have confirmed that you are the owner of *****@yahoo.co.uk. An additional email with a link to reset your password has been sent to this email address."" However, despite this confirmation, I never received the promised email with the reset link.I’ve tried reaching out to support several times, but I have yet to receive any meaningful response or assistance. It feels like my issue is being ignored, and the lack of communication is extremely frustrating. I understand that support can sometimes take time, but a week with no progress is far too long, especially when I am following all the necessary steps.I really need to regain access to my account, and it’s disappointing to see such poor support in handling this. It’s becoming clear that Microsoft’s support system is either overwhelmed or not as effective as it should be.",1,2025-02-12T15:20:16.000Z

Victor Mercado,Microsoft has my files hostage,"For the past two years, I’ve struggled with an ongoing issue with Microsoft. Recently, I spent about 10 hours discussing this with indifferent support staff. While they quickly charge my card for the annual subscription, their payment processing is flawed. After my wife changed her credit card, they still charged an inactive account.Despite reaching out for help, I had to explain the problem repeatedly, suggesting they don’t log our conversations. They raised my subscription price without notice, and I’ve overpaid because of their mistakes. They refunded my last $99 payment and promised a credit but only gave me one month of coverage before canceling.I decided to stop using Microsoft and wanted to download my files from the past three years. However, they refused access unless I purchased a new subscription, despite those files being created when my account was active. Now, I'm locked out of my resume and important schoolwork, risking their loss unless I pay for a subscription. It's frustrating that a public company would hold my personal files hostage like this.",1,2025-05-08T20:03:27.000Z

Chris Houghton,MICROSCUM OFFICE 365,"If I had the chance, it would be minus 10. Microscum has got to be one of the most corrupt and ruthless companies on the planet. I was diagnosed as being ""chronically anemic,"" and it has a similar effect to dementia. Been confused for weeks and needed to reset my PC and download Office 365, NOT knowing there is no Product Key for ONE  DEVICE. I paid over £72 to MS for Office 365 in 3 months. I am 71 on a small pension and Type 2 diabetic & this condition. I appealed to Microscum for a refund as I had paid so much and left myself short. I waited online for over an hour the first time, 116 in front of me, and as I tried to explain, they cut me off. A few days later, I tried again as it is so unfair to rob me of this money, especially in my condition, the 2nd time for 90 minutes and after finally getting to speak to someone, they would not offer any refund. I have written to cancel Office 365 in disgust, but every day they try to take money again. Yesterday for £8.49 and today for £10.49 and highlights the dangers of Continous Payment Authority they are impossible to cancel and hundreds examples of people paying for months after cancellation. CPAs should be banned. Nothing wrong with a direct debit. Sent numerous messages to cancel MS are one of the top 5 biggest companies on the planet, are STILL trying to RIP ME OFF, not content with the £72 that they have already taken.  I must always keep a zero balance to prevent further payments.  Does anybody know who the Regulator is for MS and an alternative? I only need WORD and PDFs now as I retired in November, but very bitter and feel cheated by MS for exploiting a 71-year-old with dementia AND STILL trying to take more money every day. Is Bill Gates that hard up, he has resorted to robbing pensioners now?",1,2025-05-05T20:26:22.000Z
Susie Pilkington,Microsoft accounting error created havoc for me,"A Microsoft accounts glitch created a world of pain when it registered that my subscription had not been renewed (this is an automatic payment that Microsoft initiates against my credit card each year). Not knowing this payment had not registered at Microsoft, I reported tech issues in trying to activate the apps on a recently purchased laptop. The Microsoft Tech guy tried over four hours to work on the activation issue, while I had to sit in front of my computer to give them access. Then, when two days later I was still getting 'error' messages, it took the tech guy more time until he spotted that it appeared my subscription had not been renewed. The accounts person at Microsoft then told me I needed to open a new account. All very confusing and time consuming. They finally discovered that my subscription payment had been received which meant I had renewed and paid for a new account! They simply credited the original cost of renewal back to me (without advising this) and left me on the new, higher cost account. In compensation for the hours and hours of trying to sort out the issue, which was always Microsoft's mistake, I asked for a 'gratis' renewal of next year's subscription. I got a one sentence answer ""Please note we are unable to issue a credit for the renewal next April of the new account you have."" Since this effectively would cost Microsoft nothing, it's very poor service. And now may cost Microsoft more as I explore what other options may be available for some very basic apps that I require.",2,2025-05-05T06:07:20.000Z
Andrew Corbett,By far and away the worst service I…,"By far and away the worst service I have ever received from any organization in my entire life.  Our account got hacked and deleted, so there's hurdle number one - you need an account to log in.  Eventually overcoming that barrier, I lodged a case (which took 90 minutes), I then received a follow up email which I responded to and received an auto acknowledgment of (subsequently I sent 3 more emails).  I then received a warning my case would be closed as they hadn't received responses (which I immediately replied to with copies of the emails I had sent).. then yesterday the inevitable ""your case has been closed as you didn't reply"" - AGAIN, I had received auto acknowledgments.  Last night I spent another 90 minutes ...  the first operator said they couldn't help because the case I gave was corporate (strange that, as the questionnaire they sent me discussed Xbox!!)......they then gave my 1800 numbers to call.....when I did, and said it related to a hacking, it sent me a link to the chat via text and said it can't help.......then hung up.  I tried calling back each different 1800 number and it recognised my number and said refer to chat, and hung up....I then logged in again to chat this morning as I made sure there was a read receipt this time for my reply and simply asked that they add that to my file notes in case of further issue.  After 45 minutes they finally agreed.... I then asked for an email address for complaints and they said there isn't one.  By this time, getting more and more frustrated, I simply said ok if the same thing happens again I will complain to Australia's Consumer Affairs and was told....""do as you please""...... What an absolute disgrace.  They take your money for an annual subscription, you get hacked and you can't use it....  and they could not care less.

Andrew,Business Support is an absolute JOKE!,"Microsoft Office 365 support is an absolute JOKE!I pay every single month for 365 Business Premium.As a result of their migration to EntraID, my entire staff got locked out of all their systems because of an error relating to this. For 5 days. Business Critical doesn't mean ANYTHING to these people - for a company providing a cloud based system for businesses, you would think that business continuity would be something they would consider and when you tell them that your entire business' systems are locked out, they would act immediately. No.As the global admin, I was also unable to enter to resolve the issue. In addition, my authenticator app went wrong, meaning I couldn't authenticate my log in. I re-download the app like the support suggest. When I then tried to log int Authenticator, it asks me to authenticate using the app I am trying to log into.So, I have to cancel ALL my appointments with my clients and spend 5 days on HOLD, waiting for call backs that never materialise, and resort to calling 30 minutes just to get updates. It is absolutely ridiculous.This company is an absolute joke and I shall be moving to another solution as soon as I am able to regain access to my acocunt.I should mention that even as I write this review, I still have not had a resolution and we are half way through day 5 of my business outage.We are losing trade, I am spending money - I will be submitting a claim and involving our solicitors if I have to.Not to mention, there is no way of getting through to anyone if you are locked out of your account as the automated message just says 'log a support ticket in your 365 account'.I did, however, find a work around! When it asks what your problem is, say Data Protection. Then say you are using 365 - it will connect you to an agent.But that agent isn't someone who can actually help. They are just someone who will route your call. So you will then spend an epoch on hold...When you are on hold, sometimes you can be on it for 5 hours (like I was). So eventually I dialled in from a different line to then find that the office is out of hours and I would have to call back tomorrow.Any businesses considering using Microsoft 365 Business products for their IT infrastructure, don't bother!

Mark,Poor support and paying for unusable software,"As a programmer, I have never found a Microsoft support article that answers any question I have had — very frustrating.Changing one’s Microsoft password can make it impossible to use their software.

What kind of an ^*#!*# designs security like this?! You have to hunt online through endless questions of people with similar issues to go through a complex process to get Authenticator to spit out a 6-character security code. The problem is that Visual Studio still does not accept this code even though we have a license!Since January, 2024, I have been getting rid of all personal and business vendors that have poor support (using Trustpilot, Google Wallethub, TripAdvisor, etc. and other reviews — sorted by most recent first).

They are not IT people at all. They follow some questions that they have to ask, very likely they have the questionnaire in front of them and they tick whatever they asked and checked. They do not know difference between application, website, portal. My problem supposed to be escalated yesterday instead - I had to talk and later chat with people asking me the same questions and when they could not help me sending me to the same help - contact us link again.

Charles Neri,Frustrating and Unresolved Account Recovery Process with Microsoft Support,"I’ve been trying to recover my locked Microsoft account for almost a week now, and I’m beyond frustrated with the entire process. I contacted support multiple times and was given the same scripted responses. I was initially told that I could use a US phone number to receive the verification code, but even after using multiple foreign numbers (Italy, France, Colombia, and the USA), I kept getting the error message ""Try another verification method.""One representative, Jade, didn’t seem to understand my situation and repeatedly pasted the same script without offering any real solutions. After over an hour of circular conversations, I was transferred to Clint, a supervisor. While Clint acknowledged the frustration, he too kept pushing the same solution without understanding that I had already tried everything. I’m left feeling like I’m going in circles with no real support.It's clear that the support team follows strict processes but they don't offer any flexibility or genuine help. I was told that there's nothing more they could do, despite providing all the necessary details and trying multiple solutions on my end. The lack of empathy and understanding made the entire experience worse.I need access to my account, and the entire recovery process has been more of a headache than a solution. At this point, I’m not sure where to go next.",1,2024-11-27T17:51:40.000Z
Darius,"Excessive requirements, blocked access to account","First, it's impossible to get any help/support from Microsoft. Second, I have a Microsoft account that I can't access anymore. Microsoft forces me to use Microsoft Authenticator to update my account before I can get into it. I never activated this feature, but now they force me to do it. Still, the biggest problem is that I have a Visio subscription, and I can't use the software as I can't access my account. Also, I can't cancel my subscription. Can you guess why? Yup, because I can't get into my account. But they charge me for that software each month, and I can't even access invoices.Moreover, it's unclear why they are enforcing this security measure to the point where they ask for an authenticator to access my account. I'm using a username, password, and 2FA in the form of SMS. It's already enough to identify the user, but they want to go further by pushing everyone to use unnecessary apps.",1,2024-11-26T14:01:15.000Z

Of course, it works fine with any Apple product like an iPhone or iPad but try using it on a Microsoft Windows PC and it is utter trash. For some reason it ceases to sync. I have spent countless hours on the Microsoft Support Website following all of their instructions to no avail. Either the instructions have no effect or, even worse, the instructions are not even based on the current Windows system - I'll give an example, if you, following the support website's instruction, type ""OneDrive"" into the search box on the bottom left it DOES NOT lead to the OneDrive app popping up (as Microsoft Support claims) instead it leads to the door ajar onedrive bit which is just a folder.

And their technical crew has never contacted me. This company has totally lost all empathy with regards to their customers, and make excuses and hide in their new policies.

kelcie,Microsoft customer service is horrible,"I am really upset with Microsoft. I have an account and somehow I ended up with 2 accounts and was being double billed. The first rep I talked to was very good and helpful. But since I decided to keep that account, I had to start another ticket for the other account. That is when the problems started. Not only was I being double billed because of the 2 identical accounts, but then they decided to charge me again on the account I was trying to close. So on November, I received 2 changes on the account I was trying to close. I kept asking about the refund and was ignored and the guy I spoke to, after he closed my account said he would call me back about it. Well guess what, he has not called me back. I reached out to another rep and he did not reach out back. I was going to put in another ticket, but since the account is closed, I can't open up a ticket on the account and the phone was not helpful; I got hung up on by the automative voice.So basically, this company robbed me. I honestly would have understood about not getting refunded from the 2 accounts, but then I get an extra charge on the account I am trying to close, and now they don't even respond.It is a shame that because I need the office suite, I have to still do business with the company.

Bill Campbell,I am writing to express my extreme…,"I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the OneNote product and its recurring data loss issues. As a long-time user of Microsoft products, I have always held your company in high regard, but my recent experiences with OneNote have left me feeling frustrated and betrayed.It is disheartening to know that OneNote has a history of data loss problems. Despite this, Microsoft continues to allow users to input sensitive and important information into the application, only to have it disappear without warning. This is a significant flaw that has caused immense inconvenience and stress to countless users.I have personally experienced the frustration of losing valuable notes, documents, and research due to OneNote's data loss issues. This has had a negative impact on my productivity and has eroded my trust in the product. It is unacceptable that a company of Microsoft's caliber would allow such a fundamental problem to persist for so long.I urge Microsoft to take immediate action to address the data loss issues in OneNote. This could involve investing in more robust data backup and recovery systems, improving the application's stability, or providing users with clear and effective tools to prevent data loss.I hope that Microsoft will take my concerns seriously and work to restore my faith in OneNote.",1,2024-09-13T14:37:56.000Z

He than gave me another number to call and every 3 seconds you have to push #1 to stay on the line. After what felt like an eternity I spoke to somebody who advised that they don’t deal with Xbox issues. This number was given to me by MICROSOFT CUSTOMER SERVICES.For such a large company the customer service/support is absolutely diabolical.

I cannot express how bad the support is and I made a Trustpilot account just to talk about this, because this is NOT okay.One thing is the wait times of at least 30 minutes to even speak to a human (if you manage to get past the automated AI system). And sometimes they will even just hang up on you while waiting. And then you have to fully restart the call, wait another 30 minutes and gamble if they will answer or not.They have hung up on me up to 8 times during waiting for no reason, and I've often spent hours just trying to get an answer.When they finally do answer, they are either incompetent, or transfer you to someone or somewhere else.This is NOT okay.Please Microsoft, FIX YOUR SUPPORT SERVICES!",1,2024-08-26T14:19:12.000Z

This worked for the password problem, but now my address book is empty despite pointing to the Contacts folder that contains all of my contacts.  I contacted Outlook chat support through the Outlook Help tab.  That has been beyond frustrating.

Yelena,DELETING THE WHOLE DRAFT IF YOU SIMPLY CLOSE AN EVENT ATTACHMENT,"The only reason I gave two stars is because the rep did his best at helping me and he is not to blame. The massive issue lies in Microsoft's failure to fix the problem on a programming level. I worked on my email draft for almost a week, as a lot of research was involved. All i had to do is attach a few images from my phone. So I used my iphone app and instead of attaching an image, I accidentally clicked on event attachment. So I closed it. Instead of just removing the event, the whole email draft was deleted! Without any warning. Zero logic involved. So, I thought ok, it's probably in my drafts. Nope, it wasn't. Checked the deleted folder, not there either. Checked the junk, sent, recoverable, NOT ANYWHERE!!!! The fact that closing an event deletes the whole email FROM EVERY SINGLE PLACE is an actual thing, is UNFATHOMABLE! I can delete picture attachments, but clearly event attachments come with EGREGIOUS, IRREVERSIBLE consequences without any information, logic or warning. Are you guys ok??? This is unacceptable! I spent ONE HOUR on 3 phone calls and almost TWO hours on live text trying to understand how to possibly undo this crazy situation, IF I AM LUCKY after doing that 3-4 times within a 24 hrs period. Not to mention that you clearly outsource your customer service to India and there is a language barrier which complicates the process even more. I googled this issue and seems like endless other people have had the same problem forever now, yet NOTHING has been done to fix such a huge failure. It's like closing a car window and your whole car shuts off mid driving, just because you closed one window. And then the dealership makes you run diagnostics 3-4 times within a day to MAYBE fix the issue. It's YOUR JOB TO ELIMINATE THE ISSUE FROM HAPPENING, NOT THE USERS JOB TO DEAL WITH WAYS TO FIX YOUR FAILURES through torture and wasted time. It's 2024. Get it together, Microsoft. Erasing an event attachment should have nothing to do with erasing the whole email from EVERY FILE IMAGINABLE FOREVER. It's insanity and complete inadequacy on your part!

Eli Kini,Fraudulent Charges on My Account & Inaccessible Support,"On September 29th, my Microsoft account was hacked, and fraudulent charges totaling $155 were made. The hacker purchased Xbox and Microsoft gift cards ($60, $45, and $50 respectively). I promptly reported this incident to my bank, and they initially refunded me and disputed the charges.However, I was shocked to find that Microsoft apparently provided ""proof"" that led to my bank reversing the credits. It's obvious the gift cards were cashed because someone stole money from my account. Yet, Microsoft clearly failed to investigate who actually redeemed these gift cards or check the IP addresses involved—none of which were linked to me. Despite this, I am now being forced to pay for fraudulent transactions I did not authorize.After this reversal, I attempted to reach out to Microsoft for a resolution, but the support system has been a nightmare. Your support menus loop endlessly, and when I finally managed to connect to a live agent, I was directed to submit a claim form—only to find the form submission button permanently grayed out. I tried every suggestion provided by the live agent, yet nothing worked. Eventually, the agent offered to escalate the matter directly, but their response did absolutely nothing to help.I am incredibly disappointed in Microsoft's lack of support for customers facing security breaches. I need an immediate resolution to this issue. I am not responsible for these charges, and I expect Microsoft to address this case properly, investigate the transactions thoroughly, and refund the stolen funds.___________________________________________""Dear Gamer,I hope this email finds you well.  This is Imane E from Microsoft Xbox Support. Thank you for contacting us and giving us the opportunity to help you fix your concern. I hope I met your expectations on this interaction. It has been a pleasure.As per the chat conversation we had about the refund request, this is a formal follow-up to your case. I have received an update from the designated team. Upon further review, it appears that the unauthorized purchases were made on September 29th, which falls outside the 14-day window for eligible refunds. Additionally, we are unable to process your request as the Gift card purchases have already been redeemed, and our policy does not support refunds for redeemed tokens. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that you have experienced, and I appreciate your understanding and patience while this problem was investigated. If any other issues arise, you may contact Xbox Customer Support and one of our support representatives will be happy to provide further assistance. Note: - You may receive an email saying that your case has been closed. But don't worry, this is just an automated email sent at the end of the chat - I would like to thank you once again for your time and cooperation. Sincerely yours.Imane E.Microsoft Xbox Support""___________________________________________THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!!

Sun,MICROSOFT CUSTOMER SUPPORT PATHETIC,"Microsoft is the worst company to deal with when you need support, they do not care except to take your money. The customer support is the most pathetic and unprofessional i have ever experienced.. They pulled a figure of $300 to fix hardware issues on Xbox but then told me it would most likely be more. Some ANDRES person kept ignoring my questions and my emails to then close my case. Is this a scam?? Even though these issues with the Xbox are well documented, and well known by Microsoft they still believe it is fair to charge the customer even when is only just out of warranty, they expect me to pay. Don’t get me started on Harvey Norman, where I purchased the Xbox. They are just as pathetic, Greedy and dodgy. I will be doing my best to avoid both companies. Shameful, dishonest and unAustralian.",1,2024-11-01T22:59:56.000Z
Mr David Crouch,Surely it should be called NO SUPPORT,Surely it should be called NO SUPPORT. I have an issue with authenticator and on line support eventually came online to 'chat'. Decided he could not help and gave me phone numbers telling me these people can help. Those 'people' are just bots telling me to log in to help.microsoft.com and I then get sent round in circles for some considerable time. The stupid system asks for me to enter a code via the authenticator app when it is the authenticator app that does not work. I then try different methods and am told you have asked for too many codes try again tomorrow. Apple is looking very attractive right now as this is a total shambles.,1,2024-10-29T09:41:15.000Z

Lllwq,Waste of time doing this for 0 reply.,"Ahhh.. Microsoft, Microsoft, where do I begin? The allowed child grooming? Perhaps, the theft? Let’s begin from the start, shall we. Woke up one morning. Decided ‘seems like a good day to play Xbox’ as I had no work or hw to do. Load everything up. ‘Oh.. it won’t let me connect to Xbox online. Must be a glitch. Lemme restart’ I restart it, still won’t work. I test my WiFi connection on Xbox, however. ‘Your console is bannedThis console has been banned for Terms of Use violations. To protect the Xbox service and its members, Microsoft does not provide details about specific console bans.For more information about console bans website link’ no reason. No explanation. No assistance. Just a good ol’ ‘fu***you’ from Microsoft. Only spent 10-11 years on this Xbox. From 360 all the way to this gen (series x), never, I mean NEVER had a console ban. But now? Yup! Microsoft are so sensitive to people who don’t cheat, break rules etc etc. people who do cheat and break rules, along with laws. They’re let off.* Ddosers on the Xbox network: where, where do I begin with this. Ddosing is a crime that can get you up to 10 years in prison and or an unlimited fine. That’s all I’m gonna say for now.* Pedophiles on Xbox network: I’ve reported, oh so many, child groomers, people trying to solicit s*x to minors, exchange n**es with minors, ask EXTREMELY inappropriate questions. All to minors. You know? Minors. What children are. Who are a good majority of your player base is.* Racism: the Xbox network is knowingly extremely racist. But that DOES NOT mean you don’t ban the users. If someone says a racial slur-you ban them. Non of this ‘oh well we can’t do it because there isn’t enough moderators’ yes. yes, you do. Don’t f***king even try to pretend like a MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY does not have the capability to purchase more computers, servers, etc etc. fix your company.

Fatemah,TRASH Customer Support...Smdh,"Lawd have mercy. I have never experienced such dismissive, incompetent, lackadaisical, underwhelming support from a major company in my life. I mean, Microsoft Support is 100% abysmal. And guess what??? They don't seem to care AT ALL, yet they want you to engage and or buy their products.I have written into support multiple times regarding me not receiving points for searches and quizzes. I have reported and sent screenshots to prove I wasn't receiving my points and to show that the issue is on THEIR end and not mine. Most recently, a support representative asked me to share alot of information about my phone and my account. I sent all of the information requested only to be.....GHOSTED. Completely ghosted. They didn't follow up at all.To be honest, I only use Microsoft for the points which equates to gift cards etc. FREE MONEY. Other than that, I use Google because this insanity of having numerous issues and they are never rectified would NEVER happen with Google. Microsoft is notorious for having horrendous customer service dating back to even over a decade ago.Lastly, Microsoft just conducted a poll which I of course took part of, they asked why do you use Microsoft? An overwhelming amount of people said because of Co-pilot which is a fairly recent roll out. And the second reason was because....wait for it...... BING Microsoft REWARDS POINTS. If Co-pilot AI didn't exist, the number one reason people would be using Microsoft is for the free money associated with certain tasks. That's it folks.Terrible customer service and they don't even seem to care. TRAGIC.",1,2024-06-09T16:58:00.000Z

Not only this but it took one member to review my account 2.5 hours then I got transferred. They told me that it was impossible for me to have purchased office and gotten a refund, which at this point I did that prior to that conversation. I needed to re-accomplish a verification task where again nothing happened. I am now on the phone currently with the sales representative(someone I did not want to get transferred to) who again did nothing and I am currently on hold with for a total so far of 1 hour and 22 minutes. I expect that this call will eventually hang up. The sales representatives, and other supporting roles of Microsoft have no idea of what they are doing or the processes involved. It is incredibly annoying that I was woken up with a 3 AM call from Microsoft for a robotic voice telling me that they are calling me to inform me that they will not be calling me. If it wasn't for the pure stranglehold that Microsoft has on companies and schools I wouldn't use them. If anyone knows of a 1:1 equivalent I am all ears. In short, Microsoft needs to hire some people from the region they are servicing. They often do not understand what I am saying and vice versa. They are incredibly rude. This is horrible and I hate it.  I have been dealing with this problem for over a full 24 hour period and I expect it to go longer than a week at this rate. An easily solvable verification task to allow me to purchase these applications. Current hold time is: 1 hour  32 minutes.",1,2024-05-15T18:28:46.000Z
Shiloh,Customer support stinks - not helpful AT ALL,After at least 5 tries I finally had a human on the line.  He was almost impossible to understand.

W,Can't get much worse than this...seriously,"Where do I begin... because calling Microsoft support for any real issue, (if you're lucky enough to figure out how to call in the first place) is a waste of time and a headache at best. Don't expect much more than basic troubleshooting as a solution and forget trying to get any real help. You'll be put on a fake line to nowhere until you hang up or the call times out, and you are limited daily. Many of the employees are rude, disrespectful, deceitful and all around unhelpful. I've spent countless hours on the phone to never have my issues resolved. So much wasted time and money. They refuse to refund purchases made as a result of hardware malfunction and direct me subsidiaries of Microsoft themselves who direct me back for purchases handled by Microsoft themselves. They play hot potato with your problems until your stress is a bigger problem than your original issue and then hang up. Leaving you exasperated, barely wanting to solve the original issue because it seems impossible to get any help from the company itself. I've had issues for over ten years now that have gone unsolved.And their Xbox enforcement team is like quite literally unreachable.Microsoft is rich enough to neglect it customers and pretend they care; just look how much they spend on advertising and then look at the reviews on this platform alone. Surely adequate customer support can't be out of the reach of the world's largest tech giant. It's almost comical how bad this situation is and frankly it's sickening to see so much progress and enjoyment halted as a result of Microsoft's incompetence.",1,2024-05-08T01:30:00.000Z

I keep answering their form questions and all they do is send an automatic reply, "" we are sorry...""  All they keep asking is, have I ever purchased something from them. I am losing work emails. No point in using their services because they will not help you when you need it. I will have to create a new email, of course it wont be a Microsoft account, and I will loose all my contacts.

Sarah Bean,Microsoft removed my access to my game,"Microsoft removed my access to a game I legally bought YEARS ago, and their customer service is abysmal. I can't reach a person, and the answering machine automatically flags your number once you list a category and after that initial call it no longer gives you options, it will tell you to go online before hanging up no matter how many times you call back.  I bought Minecraft several years ago and loved it, but haven't been able to play in recent years due to a combination of my father dying from cancer and a demanding job that left me with barely enough time or energy to do anything other than survive. I recently wanted to start playing again, and found my access to online playing was gone but I could still play offline. I was informed that microsoft had bought Mojang and that I should sign into microsoft and migrate my account. I did that, only to suddenly no longer have access to the offline worlds that my brothers and late father had helped me create. I legaly BOUGHT this game, and not they are telling me that, not only do I no longer own this game and apparently have to buy it AGAIN, but that, because I signed in, I lost the option to play offline all together. I emailed Microsoft and every response was essentially ""we can't help you"" and listing the same unhelpful response loop. I just want to talk to a person and they make it literally impossible to do so. They TOOK AWAY ACCESS TO MY GAME, and now it feels like they are holding it hostage untill I pay them AGAIN for a game I legally /ALREADY OWN/.I am appalled by microsoft. They lied in order to remove my access to my offline worlds, tell me I have to buy a game I legally already own, and then make it impossible to get in touch with someone who could actually resolve the issue.",1,2024-05-05T20:44:54.000Z

Microsoft will only do a paid repair on this and has basically said that anything that goes wrong with an item of hardware after their 1-year warranty is up needs to be paid for. My point is that a £1k laptop should last for more than 2 years and if something corrodes then it's a manufacturing issue NOT wear and tear. Do your research about how robust these computers are because Microsoft thinks they are disposable after a year.Customer service takes a week to reply and will just copy and paste the same answer over and over again so it can take months to resolve an issue, in my case my issue hasn't been resolved.",1,2024-07-17T13:25:00.000Z

I was on the phone for 3 hours and 40 minutes today also and the only helpful bit was the last 20 minutes when my call got handed over to someone who knew what they was doing.For the first 3 hours and 20 minutes a lady who was very polite completely messed up my brand new £3200 pound laptop. It got to the point where she ended up deleting my drivers for my trackpad and wifi so she then put me through to another lady who was equally pleasant but this time knew what she was doing.All in all nearly half my working day was wasted and all I originally asked was could I transfer my windows 11 pro license, I was told 'yeh of course'. Then the problem started when I gave them control of my computer. Error after error occurred until my laptop no longer worked and they ran for the hills. Fortunately they do have excellent manners so I couldn't get too annoyed and eventually a very talented lady fixed it for me.It has put me off asking them for help or purchasing anything from Microsoft for life though. 100 percent.",1,2024-03-20T21:15:46.000Z

And when they unswer, phone call all the saden will get disconnected. I don't understand why they are not supervised, or recorded at what they are doing.

Deepak Kalra,It is so hard to reach and not very helpful after the WAIT,"It is so hard to reach the contact numbers or support section just like anything else these days.  It takes you around in their Faq sections back and forth. Then there is no chat option or doesn't work.  They say we will call you when your number comes AND they call you it is not like someone is there to call.  You are basically again in a queue and listen to music. Eventually it is answered minutes later. Then I had difficulty communicating with the agent.  I told them I had a problem extending my subscription using a product I purchased from store and since my work was being interrupted and therefore I purchased another subscription to get on with my work. I am calling about the defective subscription.  However, the agent said your product is working so all is good. It took me so long to explain. Eventually, after all the conversations I was told that I will be forwarded to another person in another division of the MS. and was given a case number. I specifically asked if I need to repeat all this and start over and was told that my details and concerns will be documented.  Then I was transferred to redemption department who after a long wait eventually got connected. This person had no clue of my problems and I had to start over. Eventually this person said I can't help you and I have been honest with you etc. and don't want to provide you any wrong information.  This person said will transfer you to the next department.  Already more than 1.5 hour had been spent. After getting all info this person I will forward you to next department. This place is a nightmare and after being on 2 hours and my issue not being solved I gave up and accepted my losses as the music was still going on.

The cost is £80 a year and since Microsoft are contracted to provide support but are hopeless at it you should make them pay the £80 or face prosecution for their failure to provide the support which is part of the contract.You may know that MS recently got fined a huge amount by the EU for contractual failure.

I was told I'd be transferred to their Xbox department who knew how to deal with the particular issue.I then waited for almost 50 minutes, watching my position in the queue inch forward from 5th to 1st.When it got to 1st in the queue, nothing happened. IT continued to say that for 15 minutes. Then I tried to send a message, and was told it ""failed to send"", implying disconnection.So then I started a new session, and this time got an agent straight away - great, I thought. So once again I explained my problem, and asked for assistance. The agent then disconnected from me with no warning. Nothing in my message would have caused this - again it was calmly, politely worded and clear.I was then asked to give feedback - you can imagine what rating I gave.Terrible service - in fact no service at all, really.I had to find a workaround for my own issue, despite being charged 3 months in a row for a service I wasn't using, and was unable to cancel through their website due to it being missing from the location it clearly should have been (3 realms showed up there and this one didn't, yet Minecraft in-game told me it had to be managed there rather than in-game).",1,2024-02-19T23:07:01.000Z

The sign in page was stating that my email was not associated with an account, yet I could sign in on my phone no problem. I was concerned as I have been aware since October that there have been multiple daily attempts of access to my Microsoft account. Connected with Microsoft Support chat and was advised of steps to follow to ensure my microsoft account would not be compromised. I followed the steps advised and am now locked out of my new PC.I go through the sign in process and after signing in successfully a new Microsoft window appears prompting to set up a PIN, I get stuck in a loop that takes me back to sign in if I hit skip now and continue to get a "" Sorry there is a problem"" message if I try to proceed and hit retry. I searched Microsofts forum... many users are experiencing this and it is a known bug in Microsoft's system.  After giving up on the microsoft support chat option, I called into Microsoft support directly.I was told there are no options to help me remotely as I cannot sign in to my PC computer. Was asked if I have another microsoft computer and replied no I do not, shared I do have an apple and was told an apple would not work to access remotely. Was hung up on twice at this stage of communication. Called in again to then be told that a service technician could be sent to my house for a $200 dollar charge. My immediate response was that it was ridiculous to be charged $200 dollars to remedy a known error on Microsofts end. I was then hung up on for a third time. Called in again and was told that ""Mam, you have been advised that you can pay the $200 fee for a technician to come fix this at your house and then was hung up on once again.

At that point I wanted to completely cancel my account. It took this man an Hour and 4 minutes making me download a bunch of apps on my computer though I requested to just DELETE my account. He tells me my account is secure then began asking me about my crypto Venmo, money accounts, I asked how this even correlated to deleting my account. If my information wasn’t already compromised it for sure is now.",1,2024-02-10T01:27:21.000Z

Евгений,Great leak for hackers from Microsoft!,"New unprecedent action from Microsoft to allow even non-experienced hacker to stole your account!Now anyone can send a request for changing the authorization email of your account without any personal data confirmation. He just have to know (or guess) your skype name or authorization mail. Microsoft will send to your current email notification, that your authorization mail will be changed in 30 days (email, which can be treated easily like spam or can be just missed among other ones). And you should do some active actions to stop this process. If you don't do so - after 30 days some person gets access to your acount without providing ANY your personal data at all.That's how I lost my 20-years old skype account. Microsoft support Team blocked it for ever when I requested for support to remove hacker's mail.I never heard about so stupid information leak previously. I am really impressed.

JUANITA TIBBS,Is Microsoft engaging in scams/fraudulent policies,"The only reason I gave 1 star is because it won't allow a review without it! I have/had a subscription for Microsoft 365 and it's worked for the past 2 or 3 years but this year something went wrong...on December 28 I attempted to log into my account and it would not allow me to do so, it was blocked by a screen that forced me to renew my account even though I had auto new setup! I followed the instructions and Microsoft posted a debit to my bank account for $99.99 it was paid on January 2, 2024. Fast forward to January 29, 2024 and Microsoft auto newed my account again taking an additional $99.99 from the same bank account, I attempted to communicate with someone at Microsoft I filled out a complaint form and provided my phone number several seconds later my phone rang and it was a (Microsoft) tech I explained the situation and was put on permanent hold after 45 minutes the call was disconnected, I called the number back and was told by a recording that my only recourse was to communicate by chat on their help line. I tried that and was told that I had not been charged twice but however, they would refund the second payment and cancel my subscription...that individual also insinuated I was trying to commit a fraud or that I had been scammed, well if it was a scam it wasn't committed by me and it's funny how my funds were paid to Microsoft! After chatting with that person I went back later and was told the same thing by a different person from Microsoft about fraud and or scamming! I had to engage my bank to stop this injustice, to get my money back the bank was able to see that both payments were paid to Microsoft, however I was also told that it still didn't guarantee I would get the second refund!",1,2024-02-03T17:55:47.000Z

On two occasions, I was transferred, only to have the call abruptly terminated.Finally, after much ordeal, I discovered the correct number to call (1800 267 785) and was fortunate enough to be assisted by Earvin.

VikingBA,Bill Gates owes me a phone call and a…,"Bill Gates owes me a phone call and a discount. I just had the perfect example of how not to do customer service by Microsoft. It was horrible.I was trying to do an update on my payment info on the Microsoft website. I put in my new debit card info with all the pertinent information and the website gave me an error message that my debit card information was incorrect. I figured I made a typo so I reentered the info and got the same result. The card had worked on a different website 5 minutes earlier. Four tries later, I figured I needed to talk to a customer service rep. I put my cell number on their CSR request page and got a call within a couple minutes from Microsoft. That was a good sign but it quickly turned into a fiasco.The first person I spoke with was obviously based in the middle east from their accent. The connection was comparable to talking through two tin cans connected by a string to someone who had a really thick accent. I politely asked for a different rep. Rep #2 had a decent connection but a thicker accent (I think) than rep #1. I was able to explain who I am and what the issue was. That wasn't in their realm of expertise so that meant a transfer to rep #3. That person was understandable but didn't have the ability to comprehend why I couldn't update the card on their website and said it must be a problem with the card or my info. I explained I had used the card 5 minutes earlier on a French company's website and it worked just fine. That led me to explaining to rep #4 who I am, my MS credentials and why the previous three reps had gotten me to where I was in this situation. They were a tech service rep and did nothing with payments, so I'm guessing you see where this is going. Bring on rep #5 who got the brunt of my frustration and was actually someone who spoke decent English, unlike the previous 4 reps. She also understood that I was frustrated and she was a person in the proper department. I felt like after 30 minutes of bad English, poor phone connections, the wrong people and departments, I was finally going to be able to make my payment for another year of using Outlook. Nope!10 minutes later and after being put on hold three more times, she gets back on the line apologizes for the hold and tells that after speaking with their tech support team that ""There is a known issue with accepting payment updates on their website and our back office"". Her amazing suggestion to rectify my situation is that I go back to the website in 24 hours and try again. That was it. No offer of a discount. No suggestion that they would contact me when they fix ""their known issue"". That was not customer service.So, Bill Gates and Microsoft, my mother taught me when I was a little boy that if you are going to complain about something to offer a solution to the complaint.So here are my suggestion for Bill Gates and Microsoft to improve their customer support. First off, why don't your staff know about the ""known payment issue""? Every CSR that has any likelihood of interacting with a customer should be aware of it. I think you have the technology to easily achieve that. Why isn't there a notice about it on your website? Both of these would have prevented wasting my time and pissing me off. Why was I subjected to talking to five people who obviously learned English as a second language, three of whom were virtually unintelligible? Do people who speak Portuguese, French or any other language have to deal with middle easterners who are virtually impossible to understand? I would gladly pay more for your products if I knew that when I had to interact with a customer service rep that they could speak in an intelligent, understandable fashion, I would. Lastly, when my 42 minute call began I was informed that there would be a survey at the end. I didn't get it and I hung on in the hopes of being able to lambaste your for the abysmal service you provided. You can listen to the recording and listen to me cursing during the 9 times I was placed on hold. hashtag#Microsftsucks hashtag#BillGatessucks",1,2023-12-26T23:18:53.000Z

For 9-10 months now, they waste my time, hours, days over this. YOU CAN NOT FIND ANYONE WHO CAN EVEN STOP A RECURRING CHARGE WHEN YOU BUY SOMETHING MICROSOFT. The only way to solve this is I am now forced to change my credit card number and fill out all kinds of forms.The she-bot had me do screen captures (super weird) and made me jump through hoops like crazy just to tell me after 3 hours she can't help and hung up the chat on me. (Again, there is NO PHONE SUPPORT at all). There is one number in Washington State but they call and then hang up on you!!!!!!!!! I'm past being mad, this is all calm and factual. All bots deny that they are bots. They are all programmed that way. The bot tells me I can print out the transcript after the chat. No. She closed it and it wasn't available nor was any email sent. I was so suspicious that I copied and pasted while we were still chatting. Then you see all this info WHEN YOU DO PASTE INTO WORD OR TEXTFILE, YOU KNOW with certainty that it is a bot and you can't see that information when chatting. It identifies itself as a bot named Dev. I spent 3 hours on chat because there is no available tech support on the phone. NOR IS THERE ANY BILLING SUPPORT AT ALL! Microsoft will say they are in Washington State but you can't get an extension to call for help, even if you are CIA, they will NEVER GIVE YOU ANYONE'S PHONE NUMBER IN WASHINGTON. AFTER 3 HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH FAKE SUPPORT. The copy and paste identifies a person named Pradeep also. Not seen in the LIVE chat. At the end of the chat the bot promises that a ""supervisor"" will call. I got a call from a man who listened as I explained very nicely and he then just hung the phone up on me! And it's impossible to call him back without his extension. I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GET A NEW CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND THEN HAVE TO DO ALL KINDS OF WORK TO CHANGE AUTOPAYS THAT I HAVE SET UP. It took over a year until Truist Bank refunded the charges on my credit card.  I can prove it, so MS can't take any legal action against me.  CCBill paid me $600 for telling them about a dating website faking to be another dating website and the whole website is women bots who just are programmed to keep you buying tokens by sending you nude pictures and talking dirty. I captured about 5 ""women's"" pictures of faces and all of them are just out there on the internet. The nude pics are from free porn sites. Just a photo search with Google. I didn't have to go on porn sites as I don't do that stuff. The Google Picture search shows the pics like in Windows explorer but with URL locations that were obvious, so it was easy. I had conversations with CCBill already about counter-cyber work. CCBill did not want the headaches and sent me an appreciation bonus. I gave them absolute proof though that they were indeed all bots. It had to be court defensible. Bots have no human experience. Bad example is they never say they are tired. They are all fired up and ready to go at 4AM. There are better ways but too much for this review.",1,2024-09-11T19:50:26.000Z
Lisa,Microsoft should really be embarrassed…,"Microsoft should really be embarrassed and ashamed of itself. For such a huge company to have such poor support. This complaint is about their cashback program. About 80% of the time that I go onto a retail website...any site that you can purchase something from, a big banner pops up from Microsoft cash back. It states the percentage of cash I will get back if I purchase something from whatever site I am on. The percentage is usually between one and four percent. I have made many purchase on sites that have the cash back including Chewy, Laura Gellar Makeup, McCafe Security etc... When I finish my purchase I get an email from Microsoft within 5 minutes stating Congratulations...you have gotten cashback from this purchase. It then states to watch out for another email coming soon with the exact amount that I got back. That email never comes. The purchase will show up as ""pending"" in my Microsoft purchase history but disappears a few days later. On 11/26/2023 I spent several hours taking screen shots of the emails from Microsoft and the invoices of the purchases I made. It took over an hour to locate how to file a complaint with Microsoft. They of course didn't respond so I sent another enquiry. They emailed back that they were working on it. I followed up 3 more times. It has been 6 weeks. I have gotten 3 emails saying that they were working on it. Now in their defense...the cash back does work when you physically go into a store and then scan your purchase. I usually get one to three cents back for those purchases. Sometimes if there is a special deal on something I may get a couple of dollars back. The pop banners when surfing the web are extremely intrusive and annoying so the least they could do is give me the money for the purchases. If they can't properly manage the program, they should get rid of it. It is frustrating for those of us who use Bing and it should be infuriating to the companies that advertise and supposedly give the cash back",1,2024-01-19T22:12:39.000Z

It was dealt with in such an inept manner that the fraud was allowed to continue for longer than it should ever have been able to.  Manohar who dealt with the issue was beyond incompetent.  This was recognised by Microsoft and once the fraud was resolved by the Escalations Team I was offered £1,000 compensation in February 2023.  I have still not received this money!!!  I have chased on numerous occasions and even copied S Nadella in to emails but still this continues on.

Mike O'Malley,Microsoft is a Disease,"Microsoft 365 has some of the worst changes I have ever seen.The style window is a mess. It jumps around instead of letting you apply styles. The apply style pane is a nice addition but far from makes up for the odd decision to make the style window jump around on its own as you scroll through your document. There is already a view that lets you see what styles are applied so adding it somewhere where it's not needed seems silly.Then, they change the zoom in and out hot keys? Why do those need a hot key? It was easy enough to click. What did they get rid of to do this you ask? En-dash, no break dash, em-dash. What!?! You know things essential to publishing and writing. The people who do the most complicated stuff in this program who spend the most amount of time in this program. I hardly consider zooming in  and out of a document so highly necessary of a process that it needs a hot key. You must be completely out of your minds.These are just two of the more annoying changes, but everyday my workload is slowed down by your unnecessary, often detrimental changes to Microsoft (especially Word).It's as if they only poll teenagers writing high school papers when making changes to Word. All these changes will make a high school students paper slightly more convenient to work on at a much greater expense to the actual working people. Did you ask a single publisher, writer, editor how they use the program? Did you consider the professional user at all in these changes? I would be astounded to discover that you did.Don't even get me started on the new Outlook. What a joke. They hid the add signature button behind a group option. It's as if it were designed by someone who has never actually seen Outlook, let alone used it.If I were in charge, I would fire the entire team working on Microsoft 365 and start over because this is unacceptableAn absolute disgrace.Microsoft community shouldn't be the only place I can give Microsoft feedback of this nature. When you cut yourself off from your users this is what happens. I have tried everything to get to customer service and have failed over and over again. I either get a robot that can't/isn't actually designed to help or I wait all day for a phone call that either doesn't come or is a representative with no ability to actually do anything. This company is unwilling to communicate with its user. It's as if they are actively avoiding customer service.I can only implore that everyone who sees this comment heeds my warning and abandons Microsoft products. We deserve better and the monopoly of Microsoft is pumping out garbage and forcing us to pay top dollar for it.Microsoft is a disease.",1,2023-12-05T20:15:52.000Z

Jonathan Alvis,Don't Buy Microsoft Hardware If You Want Support,"Microsoft has the worst customer service and warranty policies I have ever come across. I, and my colleagues, will never buy Microsoft hardware products again.I purchased a new Microsoft Surface Pro Laptop Studio in late September and upgraded to a Professional Windows license in early October. In early November, when the laptop was just over one month old, the battery died and would not charge. I raised a maintenance request with Microsoft and had to find my own packaging, drive to a UPS parcel point and post the laptop back to Microsoft.Over two weeks later, I received a laptop through the post with a sheet inside saying it had been fully checked, switched it on, and the laptop, now with a Home license, kept switching itself off every two minutes saying the battery was dead, even though it was plugged in.I then spent some time on live chat (two minutes on/two minutes off) with the agent wanting to start everything all over again with regards to the issues. Eventually they understood that live chat wasn't working and gave me a phone number. I called this number many times, selecting many options, all of which ended up telling me to go to the website and hanging up.Eventually, I got through to a real person, who wanted to go through everything again, and eventually figured out that my original laptop had been sent back to me in error.Two days later I received an email to restart to whole return process again, and was told that I would received a refurbished (second hand!) laptop in replacement - even though my original laptop was only one month old!This whole process has been completely unacceptable.

D Collins,Ticket #‎2311100050000971,"Ticket #‎2311100050000971For anyone that is interested I can substantiate with evidence everything I outline below. Unfortunately it is all true and not exaggerated.I have spent a month, more than 10 phone calls, 2 different agents, 42 emails and nearly 5 hours on the phone to resolve an issue with my email archive. I don't want to spend this much time on my email archive. But I have too, because otherwise I will need to spend (keep spending) every morning identifying emails I only sort-of-need and deleting them, in order for my customers to email me. We receive 120,000 emails a year.I have changed archive policies three times with the agent on the phone, ran multiple powershell commands, un-linked and re-linked the archive 4 times with the agent on the phone. Each time he takes the information, goes to the 'technical team' who respond and say something in my account is misconfigured and I need to start the whole process again (delete and re-create the archive policy, run powershell, unlink and re-link archive, do it on mac, do it on windows, one more time, try it again).A month on, and the response is still 'lets just try one more time, dot the i's and cross the t's'. I am sick and tired of it. I have a computer science degree, this is not user error. I should have instead spent my time making my own email client - I might have been done already. You have a genuine bug that you need to fix. But you are too profit focussed to assign any real engineers to it.Because of Microsoft's monopolistic position, I have to be subject to the worst customer service in the universe. I dont know if Bill Gates did this on purpose in the pursuit of profit, or if the company has just atrophied over time.My only recourse is to write reviews like this and to tweet about it.

Maybe they only care about large company customer service, but they clearly don't give a s**t about individual consumers.   Horrific support with Microsoft 365.   Been trying for 4 weeks to get support as Outlook isn't working properly.    I've had troubleshooting with about 10 techs, including 4 ""Level 2"" as the first level couldn't fix the problem.   The last Level 2 said ""Sorry, Level 3 will reach out to set up a virtual session.""  2 weeks later, nothing happened.   Just got off a 22 min call on hold, with tech saying ""Stay on the line so I can file a Level 3 request.""  Call got dropped - they never called back.   So, so so so bad, unprofessional.

Small Business Owner (UK),Concerns of Privacy Breach and Poor Support,"I called the UK support number 03448002400 and spoke to support due to a 2FA login issue via the authenticator app. My business is small, but essentially we are unable to operate which is costing my business approx £16.00 per minute when downtime. Its also now potenially cost me a £20,000 client sign up, due to unable to access a presentation and cancelled meeting.Extreamly disappointment in Microsoft. But wait! Its not finished yet!1. After navigating the website for about 2 hours, i finally got a number to call and speak to a real person.2. That person was really polite, but asked to do a full desktop screen share via a URL link to see what the issue is and they would 'fix it'. So we did. Only to be told after sharing my screen and walking through my computer and issues that the person cant provide a 2FA code, or change my business number so i can manually reset. So, what was the point in the screen share? I told them it was a 2FA code issue and if they cant do that, then im confused as to why ask the access. I get it wont be a scam, but it feels invasion of privacy. GDPR states to see or store data that is relevant. There was no relevant reason for the support to ask for that screen share. Fuming!3. Once I said that was not great!, i was told that i could contact the correct department. Wait! On the same number if just called on. = FOBBED OFF.4. I challenged before i left the call, to be told thats the number. I was presented another number, but after the process, I felt i was just going to be placed back into the IVR world of Press 1,2 or 3 and get shoved onto a website self help. Whats the point in support is what i ask myself.5. The operater couldnt assure me that any of the other numbers she was providing me were not just IVR numbers, so I declined to take the number and wanted to make an official complaint.6. I was then on hold for 22 minutes and during that time, i was talking to my colleague and i said to them, Watch, i bet this call will somehow unexplained disconnect eventually so that im not dealt with because im 'complaining'.7. Guess what happend?What a waste of space microsoft is at supporting small businesses. Another example of big business not caring for the little companies.Will i call back? Yep! of course!

There was a power cut and all data in the Word doc vanished. Annoying but, I thought, a non issue as everything was backed up to OneDrive. But no! When I went to the backup it was missing, in fact so was the whole folder. This was in spite of the folder and files being clearly visible in my PC's personal OneDrive.After several hours trying to recover the file I raised a support ticket with Microsoft. Their response? 'You must have made a mistake and never backed it up...' So I sent them screenshots of the OneDrive folder on my PC showing the relevant folders and docs... With what effect. Nothing. Radio Silence.Now I see that OnDrive is not syncing lots of files.

Robert Inman,"Awful company, with no customer service standards","I raised a ticket after Microsoft blocked my account (without informing me). They initially sent a generic response to my message, before they eventually responded to my initial question. They then ignored my further emails, went back to sending generic responses/ignoring my emails. Their customer service is none existent, staff are rude, incompetent and unhelpful, though half the time it's obviously an AI bot. I will never use their services again, for anything that will make them money.",1,2023-09-20T20:41:56.000Z

Eamon,Worst Customer Support on The Planet- An Exemplar of Incompetence and Apathy,"My recent experiences with Microsoft Support have been nothing short of a calamity. It is with great regret that I must say Microsoft Support has not only failed to solve any of the problems I've encountered but has also showcased an astonishing level of ignorance, apathy, and ineptitude.First and foremost, it is apparent that the support team lacks the basic ability to comprehend the issues presented to them. It is as if they have developed an art form of responding to tickets without actually reading them. Their responses are generic, irrelevant, and often border on the absurd. It is astounding how a company of Microsoft's stature can employ a support team that seemingly couldn't care less about resolving customer concerns.Furthermore, the depth of knowledge displayed by the support team is abysmal. It is painfully evident that they lack the expertise required to address even the simplest of issues. Their responses often involve vague and misleading instructions that only serve to exacerbate the problems at hand.It is also disheartening to suspect that team members may have been appointed based on nepotism, favoritism, or other dubious criteria rather than their actual qualifications. This would explain the utter lack of competence and accountability within the support team.It is worth noting that my experiences with Microsoft Support have left me with the unsettling impression that they may engage in dishonest practices. For instance, altering the date of ticket submissions and assigning a different person to inquire about the issue are just a few examples that suggest their unethical conduct.In summary, Microsoft Support has proven itself to be the epitome of incompetence and indifference. Their inability to solve problems, coupled with their ignorance and lack of accountability, has led me to the conclusion that they are the worst support team on the planet.  Furthermore, it is imperative for authorities, including the U.S. government, to conduct a thorough investigation into Microsoft's practices, as there are alarming indications of client mistreatment, negligence, and misleading of the public.",1,2023-09-18T11:41:38.000Z

Alice,Disappointing response to fraud/refund,Have been hacked over 3 weeks ago and £900 spent on equipment and games on account linked to Microsoft account. Customer services response is appalling - have had same conversation 5 times to be told should get a call back in 72 hours and has been escalated to security who have all the information which have given on hacker email address and also physical name and address for the equipment and then hear nothing back. Can’t recover the account and can’t seem to get a refund. The customer service people speak to are understanding but they have no ability with the way Microsoft is set up to actually do anything. Incredible that a company of this size and brand thinks so little of loyal customers who in my case have been paying them for years that when a clear criminal breach occurs they haven’t got a proper process to address it. Have just had the same conversation again to be told someone will call you in 72 hours and very low expectations anything will be done.,1,2023-08-12T13:13:09.000Z

It’s now 27/7, I’ve still no controller, no email to say it’s been dispatched and I’m getting emails asking if everything is ok and if my issue has been sorted. NO IT HASNT.

Wolf Lyonscrown,Xbox help is abysmal.,"I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my disappointment with the customer service I received from your company. Unfortunately, the recent encounter has left me with a negative impression, prompting me to consider taking my future business to one of your competitors.During my recent interaction with your customer service department, I encountered several issues that greatly impacted my overall experience. The problems I faced include:Prolonged Response Times: I found it incredibly frustrating to experience prolonged waiting periods for a response from your customer service team. It appeared that my concerns were not being addressed in a timely manner, which added to my frustration.Lack of Empathy and Understanding: The representatives I communicated with seemed indifferent to my concerns and lacked empathy towards my situation. It is essential for customer service representatives to show understanding and compassion when dealing with customers.Ineffective Solutions: Despite explaining my issue in detail, the solutions provided were either generic or did not address the root of the problem. As a result, I was left dissatisfied and without a resolution to my issue.Poor Communication: There was a significant lack of communication between different departments, leading to confusion and misinformation. This lack of coordination only exacerbated the problem and made the entire experience even more disheartening.As a long-standing customer, I had always valued the products and services offered by your company. However, the recent customer service experience has severely diminished my trust and confidence in your brand. Customer service plays a vital role in shaping the overall perception of a company, and unfortunately, my recent encounter has been disappointing.I believe in giving feedback in the hope that it can help a company identify areas for improvement. However, I regret to say that unless significant changes are made to address these issues, I have decided to explore alternative options for my future purchases.I sincerely hope that you take this feedback seriously and use it as an opportunity to make positive changes to your customer service approach. By doing so, you can enhance customer satisfaction and retain loyal patrons like myself.Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward to seeing improvements in your customer service, which might encourage me to reconsider my decision.",1,2023-07-27T20:41:22.000Z

Mike Juretzky,Microsoft’s Dirty Little Secret (Hint: Think Of Your Personal Data),"Another Message For Clare Barclay CEO Microsoft UK (Email: clare(dot)barclay(at)microsoft(dot)com)MS Complaint #: 7020450114Most people realise and accept that it is normal for personal data to be requested and then stored safely by a company when signing up for their product or service.  In my case this was to use the Microsoft Ads platform, approximately 7 years ago.  Since then, I have not used the platform for years and nor have I heard from them apart from receiving a recent email on 21st June 2023, saying they were updating my MS Ads Agreement.Really, well no, “I don’t use your platform and have not for years, so what are you still doing storing and holding onto my data on your servers for this length of time, when there is clearly no longer any relationship between us”.  There is absolutely no need for this company to store my data indefinitely.  I immediately got onto them and informed them that I wanted this account with all my personal data deleted.  However, up until this point and this is after many emails back and forth, I still do not have their assurance that this old account with my personal data has been deleted.I would strongly advise anyone that is thinking about purchasing a Microsoft product or service to think again.  This is a company that has an extremely poor record when it comes to Data Breaches.  Just Google, “microsoft data breaches” and be prepared to be astonished at the size, depth and frequency of Microsoft’s data breaches in the past.  This company clearly has little regard for the safe storage of my personal data and this is why I have insisted and still do insist, that they delete everything.Furthermore, I say to this, where is the law in all of this, I ask you?  It should be if there is no longer any reason for a company to hold on to peoples personal data (such as in my case), then by law they should have to delete it automatically.  If companies like Microsoft do not follow this, then they should have hefty fines imposed upon them to act as deterrent.  This would hopefully prevent these corporations from continuing to put our personal data at risk.Also, if any of you are contemplating getting Microsoft Windows 11 (despite my warning about purchasing any Microsoft products and services above) and are told you need a Microsoft account (Just another way Microsoft can take your personal data hostage or worse!) to do so, you don’t.  Simply, Google, “windows 11 without ms account”.  I strongly advise that you take this step to protect your personal data.If my review of this company prevents a single person from having their personal data held hostage or worse being hacked and falling into the wrong hands, then it has done its job!  And, Microsoft be so good if you will as to delete all my personal data from your servers and confirm this in writing, would you.  Thanks so much.Less than 1hour Later...Wow! Less than a hour after posting this review I got confirmation from Microsoft saying, ""the deletion operation has been done successfully."". A clear statement confirming that the MS account in question and all my personal data have been deleted!Now MS, perhaps you should amend your policies to ensure that when one of your customers says they want their data deleted when there is clearly no further relation between Microsoft and said customer, YOU DO IT IMMEDIATELY!",1,2023-07-19T16:45:57.000Z

My bank have also been in touch with Microsoft but if they dispute my claim I will lose the money.Since I have already reported FRAUD I want MICROSOFT to stop claiming this money, I DO NOT OWE IT!I have spoken to them once by phone, they have now changed the way in which you contact them and it is impossible to contact customer services!I am hoping a negative on here will get them to contact me.",1,2023-10-24T17:57:37.000Z
Sam Hodgson,Worst customer service I’ve ever…,"Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Signed up to a business account last week. Went to change the email address whilst on a call with support who were screen sharing. Got completely locked out of my account & was advised that a ticket would be raised to get access back as the support guy didn’t know what to do. 5 days later I’m still waiting so I call Microsoft. Spend 1hr 15 mins on the phone, passed to 6 different departments & spoke to 7 different people. Advised previous support guy hadn’t raised a ticket & that they would escalate as urgent & i’d have a call back within 20-30 minutes. I’m still waiting an hour later & nothing. All it needs is a password reset yet a massive technology company like this can’t manage it. No one seems to have a clue what they’re doing, I can’t access my work emails which is having a huge effect on my business, and Microsoft just don’t care.

Jay,Programs disappeared from screen upon execution,"My problem was when I ran a program it would disappear from the Taskbar and screen.  It was running in Taskbar manager, but the program was not visible.  I contacted Microsoft support for the first time in my life.  Had no problem connecting with customer service.  The r ep wanted to access my system to resolve the matter.  I reluctantly agreed.  He made a test account to see if the problem occurred in the new account.  The switchover to the test account took UNUSUALLY long.  The rep was based in West Africa.  He confirmed he still had access to my original account while I sat waiting on the blue screen to switch to the test account.  Red flags were popping up in my head right and left.  Something wasn't right AT ALL.  I eventually shut my system down, and as soon as I did the rep immediately asked, why.  I'm convinced he was delaying the switchover to the test account so he had time to explore my system.  I could hear him pecking keys in the background while I sat there waiting for the test account to switch over.  Not a pleasant experience at all!  Never again!!",2,2023-10-17T03:55:33.000Z

Tasha,The worst customer service I have ever experienced!,"I have never experienced customer service like this!!I received an email from Microsoft suspecting 'unusual activity' on my email account. Fair enough, I was in Spain at the time and maybe the location was the unusual activity. At this point I was asked to sign in and validate my email. I then tried to sign in and was told I needed to be sent a verification code and the only option available was to my phone number. Unfortunately, this was an old number (these things happen)This is where is where the issues started:Was told to fill in a recovery form, as I could not match the phone number. I filled out the recovery form, baring in mind it is an old email and I am being asked questions like "" Have you ever had a Microsoft Account, and if so can you provide bank card details used"" Well no, I have had many back cards since opening this account.Anyhow, I filled in details and got a verification stating ""not enough information was provided"" and can only fill the recovery form out 2 times a day.After countless recovery forms and online chats and phone calls, I was told to keep trying. Frustrated and angry, I gave up.Fast forward 6 months later, I still had access to previous emails on my iPad, I was browsing and found a Microsoft Account I used to own, So I gave the recovery form another go!And to my surprise a few weeks later, I received an email stating recovery has been successful, finally, the relief!! I immediately clicked on the link within the email to recover my account, entered my address and was met with a message ""Try entering your Microsoft account again. We don't recognise this one""After months of trying to recover my account, finally being granted access to be told, the account is not recognised. Straight away contacted Microsoft again, explained the situation. This is where my frustrations stem from, the team have no customer service skills whatsoever, there is a clear language barrier which makes it difficult to communicate, the same rehearsed replies, such as ""we know this is frustrating for you to have no email"" clearly copied and pasted from previous discussions. No sense of clarity on how to fix the issue, and always ends in, ""I will pass this on to another team who will contact you"" and they never do!! They don't even attempt to try and fix the issue, no questions, no checking the system to even identify if the account is still active!This is a joke of a company, filling their pockets and they can't even provide a decent customer service team! Can see where their budget isn't being spent!",1,2023-10-16T15:03:09.000Z

Christina Wood,Worst Support Experience Ever!,"My recent interaction with Microsoft support left much to be desired, resulting in a frustrating experience that I can only rate as 2 stars.From the get-go, connecting with Microsoft support was a challenging ordeal. The wait times were excessive, and the automated menu system was complex and counterintuitive. It often felt like they were making it unnecessarily difficult for customers to access assistance.Upon finally reaching a human agent, I was disappointed by their apparent lack of expertise. I had hoped to find a solution to a relatively common issue, but the agent's troubleshooting guidance was generic and, unfortunately, offered no new insights. It seemed like they were merely going through the motions, which was not very helpful.",2,2023-10-12T13:49:32.000Z

fay lewis,A LOT OF STRESS AND A LOT OF TIME WASTED TO END UP NO WHERE!!!,1) Considering Microsoft is this large company in a space of 2 weeks of setting up my account it was hacked and multiple transactions were taken (clearly their security system is useless)2) Unable to call customer help and with great difficulty managed to find a chat help line 2 hours later they concluded that they couldn’t refund or cancel these transactions we didn’t make and to contact x-box as that was where the purchases were made (well I don’t have an x-box or have I ever set up an x-box account)3) X-Box are completely useless and do not have customer help or support towards fraud which is disgusting. So we managed to find a refund page where there was a loop saying that if I didn’t make the purchase then I must change the password which I did but still couldn’t get a refund!!!A lot of stress was caused and a lot of time was wasted and a simple phone call to a real person would have made a big difference even if there was wait.,1,2023-09-16T13:47:16.000Z

Mick Belford,I wish I could give them no stars,I wish I could give them no stars. Their system is clearly designed to frustrate people to the extent they give up. I put some credit on my son's account so he could purchase a game. The PEGI rating was within the settings I had allowed. The system said it needed parental approval. I received an email and clicked the allow button but whatever way I tried it would not then let him make the purchase from the money on his account so I had to purchase it using debit card. So he now has £90 credit on his account I do not want him to have. After much effort to try and discuss this with someone I eventually managed to submit a request for the money to be refunded but this was refused. When I went back on the system and entered the reference number and requested to speak to someone again after much messing about talking to their bot it refused me. This is not the first time I have had this experience and my view is they have deliberately made their system over complicated  difficult to navigate and designed to put people off. They are truly awful.,1,2023-09-08T19:22:31.000Z
Helen,Lame and disappointing,"I've spent the last couple of months steadily building up Microsoft Rewards points with the intention of redeeming for a Roblox giftcard. Once I reached the threshold, I tried to redeem and was told that I couldn't because there was a problem with my order or account. I contacted Microsoft Support for help and what I received back was a boilerplate response that heavily suggested I had misused my account in some way and I would need to 'improve' in order to be able to redeem.I was given a range of ways I might have misused my account, none of which I felt applied to me, and thus I have no idea what I was doing wrong or could do better to rectify the situation. And to top it off, the email finished by telling me that this 'resolved' the matter and I would not be able to reply to that email. Okay then.So I spent a further month 'improving' my account, diligently doing tasks to earn more points. I tried to redeem again, and no change. Frankly, I think the 'support' offered is no support at all. If I'm doing something wrong, at least tell me what it is, or tell me my account is blocked so I can move on with my life rather than wasting more time getting points I'll never be able to redeem.

Space Lord,God Awful Customer Support For Victims Of A Hacked Account,"First off got hacked so I submitted a ticket to try and get it resolved only to be told that the account has been compromised, so I asked again to resolve said issue; managed to get the account back temp (so I did an emergency backup of things Lucky i did really.). Then I submitted more tickets to the point i got to Tier 2 (apparently thats a thing over there). They proceeded to ban the account in question (1 of 2 possible outcomes, they picked the worst in my opinion). They decided:""I appreciate your patience while I have performed an investigation of your account.Account security is a top priority at Microsoft, and we have a team dedicated to investigating and validating fraudulent activity. The account and billing activity associated with your Microsoft account was thoroughly reviewed by our fraud team, and I can confirm there was unauthorized access to your account. Unfortunately, during the investigation process, we found that your security information has been changed.Unfortunately, when security features are updated on an account, we are unable to assist with an account recovery as these types of updates and/or removal are completely out of control of customer service. We are unable to make any changes to the security information on the account due to security protocols set up and the acceptance of the Microsoft Services Agreement when the account was created.The only option we have is to permanently suspend this account to prevent any further use. At this time, I have successfully suspended this account, and this will remain on indefinitely.""Is the best answer for a victim of a hacked account. I must admit that is the worst putting time in, obeying their crappy rules, then to have the whole crap shut down from having access to you. I've tried numerous amounts of time to get a straight answer and I have felt that they wasted my time. Thing is with windows now requiring a hotmail/outlook account, its now scary with activation, because if an account gets hacked the only remedy is to have it closed? Nah i don't buy it!Worst contacting them EVER!  Thing is would it have been different with Microsoft Office / Windows? Doubtful. If you're in the situation of being a victim of being hacked, just do a backup is all i can suggest; don't think about for a second Microsoft will help you - they won't!",1,2023-07-07T15:56:34.000Z

Blu sky,It only took nearly a year...,"The reason I gave a 4 and not a five is because a year ago I went to 3 other agents for help with my Hotmail being compromised although I happened to be up so I quickly acted to retake and put further security on my account making it impossible to get on ever again. But that didn't stop them from trying....................I contacted almost a year ago 3 agents to see what I can do, their response was either oh they didn't get into your account anymore, or saying to do what I already wrote I did with them just assuring that they can't get in because how I now set it. I was concerned that they could fake as me since they got into my cash app and had got sensitive info, which set the nightmare for all of this... Everyday no less than 50 times a day would they attempt from places across the world many with ip's from places I've never heard of, I couldn't sit and do that daily, it was stressful. Then maybe once they figured I used an authenticator app I know I'm not physically on it to need to approve so I deny but over the last few weeks that became frequent and I went to report that it's not me but I couldn't because too many login attempts from the hackers.I was infuriated and went to get help and complain and I laid out everything but didn't blow up on the agent but was making it be known that this is unacceptable. If that Xbox acct wasn't important I would've deleted... Turns out 4 agents and nearly a year later this particular agent HAD a solution. I couldn't believe they refused to even do basic research and give me the solution that this gentleman did, he actually checked and walked me through a process where I now have my peace of mind back, it just shouldn't have took 4 agents and very close to a year later.... I rated him highest because he took me to the normalcy of the account and for that I'm internally grateful. So, there are resolutions, I just really hope it doesn't take people multiple agents. Ironically, someone in the community chat was trying to explain this same thing but they didn't explain it good or thoroughly, so I wasn't able to resolve but once this agent was done I realized now what the other from the community chat was trying to say. I can't in good consciousness give a 3 or less because that agent yesterday gave me hope that some of them really do their jobs.",4,2023-07-04T00:04:24.000Z

Michael S,Worst I have experienced,"Dealing with Mircosoft customer service has been singularly the worst customer service experience of my life. First of all finding the right number and the right options to get through to the right person is a challenge. Once you do get through to he right person there is usually little if anything they can do to help or support. Secondly, if they can, and you need to really push them hard to do anything other than read their script, it takes a long time, if they do it at all.I sent my surface pro 7 to be repaired for the 2nd time in 6 months (the same SSD fault both times and both times 1 month after warrantee expired) it too me nearly 2 weeks to persuade them that the second repair should be free. Normal process is 6-8 days from when you send the thing off for repair. It has been with UPS for 4 weeks because Microsoft made a mistake on the shipping instructions.I called UPS multiple times and they said I should call Microsoft. Microsoft says there is not much that they can do. 6 weeks and counting without the surface pro that I spent £1000 on 18 months ago. Truly pathetic from the start and no end in sight.",1,2023-06-27T13:58:26.000Z
Jeremy West,Absolutely TERRIBLE experience...,"I had an absolutely TERRIBLE experience with Microsoft Support today. At first, the support agent seemed polite, but eventually started going on a completely different path and I was quickly able to realize this agent did NOT know what they were doing, especially when we got to the remote assist part. They even said that my PC was unable to upgrade to Windows 11 when my PC was LITERALLY RUNNING WINDOWS 11 and they could CLEARLY SEE THAT.  They immediately jumped to reset and perform clean install of Windows 11 and even tried to do it WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. Not only did they ignore me when I said that I did not want my PC reset because there is extremely important data saved on my PC that I was in the process of trying to back up, but they also started going through my PERSONAL FILES when they had absolutely NO REASON to. To make things even worse, they downloaded the Windows 11 installer from the website and ran it, reaching an admin permission window with Yes or No since I'm already on an admin account. Since it's MY PC, they are not allowed by me or by Microsoft to make changes to the PC that require admin privileges without my permission. AND THEY STILL CLICKED YES. EVEN WHEN I SAID NO. I could clearly see that this was a terrible support experience. And out of nowhere, I got an urgent call from a family member and I had to leave immediately because of a family emergency. I told that to the support agent politely and said I had to leave. They told me that they still needed to fix my PC and I told him no I did not give him permission to make those changes and I absolutely had to leave right then. Since he clearly wasn't listening to me, I took control of the mouse and tried to leave the screen sharing session. HE FOUGHT AGAINST ME AND KEPT TRYING TO RESET MY PC. WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. I spent a whole FOUR MINUTES trying to fight for the cursor until I finally managed to leave the session. I immediately left the chat and left a one-star review.This support employee did not know what he was doing, constantly trying to correct me with what he thought was correct when in reality none of it actually even made sense, blatantly went against many of Microsoft's core support policies, tried to make many changes without permission, went ahead with whatever he was doing even when I told him he did not have permission, and violated my privacy. I was VERY unhappy.Microsoft seriously needs better training for their employees, and they need to be more selective about hiring like Apple Support seems to be. What happened today almost resulted in damage to my PC and the loss of over 30 GB of very very important data. I am very hesitant to ever reach out to Microsoft Support again. This really frustrates me. Very terrible experience with Microsoft Support and I should remind everyone to be SUPER CAREFUL.",1,2023-06-27T05:45:04.000Z

Les Belcher,Hacked Account - Bad Support/Customer Service,"Look, I'm sorry to be rude, but the support is shocking. There should be more support for people with hacked accounts. My Outlook email and my old Skype account I had since 2012 have been hacked, and the recovery email is something I do not recognise at all; it ends in @21cn.com when I look it up on Google. It's some email company in China. I want my account back. I have lost two Skype accounts now, and I simply cannot access them. No matter how hard I try to access them, these hackers have clearly taken them and put their emails on them, so I can't get back into them. I can literally prove it's my account, but you don't even have a live chat for support, do you?I have lost every single bit of contact information from people when I used to play on my PlayStation as a kid. I am sad that I can't talk with them anymore. Is there anyone I can possibly contact? I don't care if it's a phone number or what. I just want my account back. This is sad. It's also very difficult to lose an account I made 14 years ago. I couldn't remember the email for a long time, and now that I found the correct email, it's telling me it's not valid, which makes me think it's been deleted from the database. At least let us recreate the same email (hotmail/live) so we can access our old emails, or let us do some sort of recovery for it? Also, get a live chat. As a multi-billion-dollar company, you can afford to get some good customer support. It's so frustrating.",1,2023-06-29T19:32:30.000Z
SifuYu,Microsoft Cheapskates,"Before I begin, I will point out, I am not easy to anger and rarely give anyone a bad review unless they done me dirty so keep that in mind as you read on.What happened: I had a custom Xbox control made from Xbox labs, this was the second one I had made from them. The first one was very well made, still use it today, however the second one had a severe defect in it and I had to send it back for repair.I went through all the steps, got the label from Microsoft via e-mail, then took it to UPS. I didn't put much thought into it beyond that, UPS never failed me before like this. So I will making a similar review on UPS as well.UPS completely lost my item in transit, whether it was stolen or lost does not matter. The fact is they lost it, and because of this I should not have to pay for another item. Yet they accept no responsibility for it at all, instead they made me go to Microsoft and deal with them, hence this review so here are the pros and cons of my experience with Microsoft.Pro: Friendly even if its purely professional courtesy customer support. I've never had a problem in the past with them because of this either, its always been that way.-I hate speaking ill of anyone, however I would be lying if I said they did well by me on this. -Con: While it was not Microsoft's fault the item was lost, it was neither mine. However rather than issue me a refund for lost item, which by the way is still under warranty.They gave me some lame excuse and then tried to toss me back to UPS to argue with them. When I told them it was unacceptable, that Microsoft is a multi-billion dollar company that $80.00 would not dent their finances in the least, and that if they refunded said controller, I would gladly buy another so that neither of us lost out.However! They just outright hung up on me, so I give them two stars for professional courtesy and 1 star for actually giving a **** about their customers.That is all.",2,2023-06-22T20:51:24.000Z

It is straight extortion since the tools to fix the problem are purposefully bad to the point it takes Hours to fix.  Also I couldn't get into onedrive because it kept running me in circles so I contacted support... that alone took a couple hours to figure out how to actually get connected to one.The tech linked to my computer and showed me how to disconnect onedrive from my computer so it would stop messing up my files (part of microsofts extortion is to literally prevent you from using your own files on your own computer), then he showed me where to go to empty my onedrive out.  BUT... he also installed trojan viruses onto my computer and tried to delete the proof that he'd done it.  I disconnected him as soon as he showed me where the onedrive was though so he didn't get to cover his tracks in time.  It completely screwed up chrome so I ran a system scan and found them.  I also noticed my recycle bin had stuff in it so checked and found his attempt to cover what he did.Microsoft support, the support so bad that if your computer is not broken they will destroy it for you...",1,2023-06-19T22:47:15.000Z

I have two iPads and an iPhone and if I need support I just tell them I need IT help and I’m connected with a live person who works with you ‘til the problem is fixed.

caroline0199sky,They don't have a good success rate!,"I have used the online chat support a few times recently for Windows 10 issues. They remote onto your computer to try and fix things. Unfortunately, they have been unsuccessful, despite them guaranting that their actions/instructions would fix the issues and what is annoying is that they ask for feedback before you know if the restart of your computer, reinstall etc. is actually going to work. Hence, I have been reluctant to do their final recommendation, which is a reset of my laptop, which would result in me losing all my apps and having to spend hours reinstalling them, when I am not confident that this would fix the problem, which is related to a Windows update anyway, and they will hopefully fix this anyway with another update. I have already spent many hours doing what they recommended and reinstalling a database, which the new Windows 10 installation messed up.A very unhappy customer.

LV,"Save me, Apple","While I understand this to be a problem of privilege, I have never experienced this sort of obfuscation on the part of a company ostensibly trying to assist me in solving a problem. Microsoft seems hell bent on keeping consumers in the problem rather than in the solution. I have been locked out of my account for 6 days now, trying to get what seems to be a simple problem with my authenticator app resolved. It appears that the app just needs to be reset, thus allowing me to access my account. However, no one at Microsoft seems to be capable of doing this. I wait for hours or days on phone calls that don't come at their scheduled times, provide the same information over and over again to different people (with the sense that they may not fully understand me), then am told the same thing by each individual with whom I speak: that they will call me back as soon as possible. Nothing changes. No resolution comes. And I wait, locked out of my account because no one can reset my authenticator app. They tell me they'll call at 3pm so I wait by the phone. No call. It comes the following morning at 5:30am. What's the deal, Microsoft? Is it that you believe you maintain a monopoly on this suite of products so you feel consumer satisfaction no longer matters? You are an absolute disgrace. This is one more reason I'm a loyal Apple product user and will remain so. I may ditch the whole Microsoft Office suite business and migrate everything over to Apple. You guys are the absolute worst.",1,2023-05-10T17:36:22.000Z

rob,If your a private customer the support…,If your a private customer the support is as good as useless. After hours of chat you can get through to a technician that takes control of your PC. Then spend a lot of time explaining the problem but they don’t appear to be able to do anything over and above basic stuff you would find on the web. It’s a war of attrition going around in circles until you give up- i’ve spent 5 hrs on these calls with the same problem and these’s no solution or progress (or escalation to a call).

Eamon Butler,Microsoftturd…,Absolute crap .they try to avoid phone contact. Eventually put me through to tech support. I had a problem with a word document spreading itself all over the pages in an unusable manner. When the tech support couldn’t help me after about 2 hours they said it wasn’t a tech problem but a format problem. But I told them what the problem was first and the put me through to tech dep. no body in Microsoft actually understands how to use Microsoft word. They just have a load of useless videos which never deal with your particular problem. The staff tells lies and hang up on you too. Load of crap. Come back Amstrad all is forgiven.

Verna Wagons,Do you wan't a laptop to work... or help build tolerance to frustration,"Let's start with the most glaring issue: the laptop's inability to handle regular programs like Google Docs without crashing. It's mind-boggling how a supposedly functional laptop struggles with a simple online word processing application. The constant crashes and freezes made it an interesting experience. Especially during online exams, if you want a laptop that builds character, this is for you.It was the highest priced laptop at the Walmart electronics counter, it's not unreasonable to assume that a laptop at this price point ($420.00) would handle basic programs in 2023. I realized after trying to get rid of it, at best buy where you can trade an existing laptop in for credit off your new one - they would not even accept a new hp stream. And they will basically accept anything.the Microsoft HP Stream Laptop failed to live up to even the most basic expectations. Its inability to handle regular programs like Google Docs without crashing, and the $400.00 price tag is a joke being the laptop that couldn't perform word adequately.Save yourself the frustration and look elsewhere for a laptop that can handle the tasks you need without constant crashes and freezes (brand new). Not sure how someone released a 2010 laptop in 2023. (Actually, that is an insult to my Macbook from 2009 that still is functional today)",1,2023-06-04T18:54:58.000Z

You would think in 50 years' time, they would have figured out a way to help their dedicated customer base, but they would rather just rake in the cash. For those who choose to stay on with Microsoft, I hope you still have hair left when you get the answer you are looking for.God Bless those who are willing to continue swimming upstream to get a rude and disheartening response, not once, not twice but 3 times in the same day. For me, I was born human, not a salmon.Goodbye to frustration, complications with every keystroke, and indifferent Customer Service Personnel, Procedures, Rules and Regulations.

I disabled passwordless and still did not allow me to sign in.I contacted Microsoft support and was passed onto multiple technical support agents where I lost count the number of people I spoke with. I had to wake up in the morning to receive their calls to screen share and they would control my computer with me to walk through the issue I was experiencing. This same process went on for weeks but with different technical agents but the same results. No one had a clue why I could not sign into Azure portal.After 2.5 months of complete frustration and anxiety that they'd never be able to figure out what the cause is or how to resolve it, I had disabled my 2FA/MFA and left it off for a couple weeks to see if that might work. Then one day after that I tried logging in and it was successful! I could not believe my eyes! I asked the technical service agent why it started working or if she knew my account started to work. She cannot confirm if it was due to disabling the 2FA/MFA or if someone had changed something on the backend to fix my account or a bug in their system. I'll never know.Upon gaining access, I immediately created another global admin (and confirmed access) so that this will never happen again. During the whole ordeal, I vowed to switch providers. I am since using the leading cloud provider instead of Microsoft Azure. I haven't migrated everything over yet but for all new resources, it's on the other provider. Over the next while I'll need to move everything.Hard lessons learned. I should have created two accounts should I lose access to one of them. Second, I would not have imagined such a terrible experience! Azure is touted to be second or one of the leading cloud providers and that may be true but with such terrible customer/technical service I am willing to try their biggest competitor. I have not heard such horror stories compared to Microsoft.PS. I have not gone into the details of some of the incompetence I had experienced with Microsoft agents, their supervisors (whose email address are in the agent's signatures), process, the many departments throwing the issue over the wall to the next department.",1,2023-04-11T05:52:16.000Z

cocaine the nose clown,I just installed the latest update,"I just installed the latest update, when finished my phone was locked and it asked for a pin , I've NEVER used a screen lock pin since I had the phone( 3 years) it's taken me hours to find the pin no, luckily I store my pw,s and log ins on another old phone that I just use to store  outside of my working phone in case of hackers, but it took me hours to find it and I think it's really bad that the update can just alter my personal chosen settings like that, and cause me the grief it did, what if I had never saved it? Or stored it ON my phone, you should let people know that big brother is all powerful and can do this before you prompt them to update, I wonder how many people are sitting there now trying to punch in the 4 big numbers that appear thinking it's a code, every 40 seconds, when in fact it's the new time format....... ridiculous.",1,2023-04-07T12:34:07.000Z

J Gibson,Xbox cheap product/warranty not honored,"Xbox  is cheaply made, customer service failed to honor active warranty. They mailed me a product that I did not request, where is the wireless controller replacement   per warranty. We  sent broken controller with ups label Microsoft support sent us and yesterday received the wrong product.I finally reached a live person with a call back and was switched  to multiple departments.   Requested another call back and they didn't call me.Customer service said they would investigate and no guarantee I would receive a controller they misplaced or a refund. She  told me to hold 3 to 5 minutes....  2 hours later I am on trust pilot  with my concerns.  I didn't fuss with Microsoft when they charged my debit card wrongly( I never checked the auto renewal box)  for Microsoft word.I thought Microsoft would honor the warranty they print and place with the items they sell. Microsoft lacks in morals , no concern for customers or the constant money we spend on games, gaming supplies and all the extra gaming needs for  a experience.  Products are cheap and  I'm tired of spending money on a company that doesn't care. This is one review, I will be writing on every review site  and notifying the government of your unlawful actions.

I have two accounts with Microsoft, one account which I have already paid for, and the other which is full. I just need to recover the password for the paid account and change my account for the paid for account instead of the free account. However, I forgot the password, and Microsoft makes the whole process to reset your security informaiton very difficult by setting a waiting period of 30 days? Really? How does this even help?If I didn't have a window laptop, I would not even touch one drive. Dropbox or any other cloud service storage will be much better than one drive",1,2023-03-05T20:18:23.000Z

Joe,I Hope Microsoft Burns.,"I recently have got a new phone. Upon doing this, I backed up my old phone and transferred all of the data from one phone to the other. Once this was done, I never was able to use my authenticator app again. But it gets worse. I would try and sign into my school email and access my documents. I can't access anything because I'm prompted into an infinite loop where I try to sign in, then it tells me to check my authenticator app (which I can't access) then I click 'sign in using another method' which ALSO TELLS ME TO CHECK MY AUTHENTICATOR APP. I called the support number, where I sat on the phone for 10 minutes with some AI bot that told me I'm a 'valued customer' which is clearly not true as they don't care enough to get a real person to talk to me. The AI bot was laughably useless. It asked me what my issue is, I spoke what it was but it didn't hear me the first four times so. It then paused for a full minute and told me to go to the microsoft website because they can't help me on the phone. When I go to the website to try and get help. GUESS WHAT????? It tries to get me to sign in with my authenticator. If I do not do that, I cannot access the website. So! If you're locked out of your microsoft account, don't even bother trying to recover it because microsoft is completely useless and abhorrent. It is an infinite loop of lying and it shows how horrible the company is. It really is disgustingly bad. I think the worst part of all of this was that I didn't even want to set up an authenticator app. I was forced to by microsoft. So now I'm stuck with this app I didn't ask for that prevents me from signing into my email. And when I ask the people who forced me to put this secondary verification in for help fixing it, I get radio silence. At the end of the day, it shows the culture of Microsoft, nobody cares about how ineffective the software is, and they don't know how to fix their problems either. For a technology company, they're pretty technologically handicapped. Horrible company, horrible service, I will never buy a microsoft product again because of this and I legitimately, with all of my heart, hope the company crashes and burns. This is the sole, one and only company that I legitimately have hatred for, pure hatred. Microsoft doesn't care about its consumers and shouldn't be used by anybody if possible.",1,2023-03-04T20:22:32.000Z

Perpetual Examiner,Microsoft 365 subscription expired in 1968!,"One evening I signed out of my Microsoft Outlook business email and that was the end of my business relationship with Microsoft. I tried to log back in, but a popup said I haven’t had a Microsoft 365 subscription since 1968!I looked at my bank statement and Microsoft has been charging me on the 3rd of every month for Microsoft 365 without any problem.No customer support “for your convenience”Microsoft has a phone number posted online as a customer service line. However, “for your convenience” they discontinued the phone support, and now you can log into your account to solve issues yourself. This is if you have an account! “For your convenience” you need to read hundreds of customer support pages which will take you nowhere. Since you do not have an account you can not log back to change or access anything.What happens when Microsoft claims you haven’t had an account for 55 years? I was wondering weather Microsoft 365 existed in 1968? So, I researched.Microsoft was found in 1975“On April 4, 1975, at a time when most Americans used typewriters, childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen found Microsoft, a company that makes computer software.”Looks like there are several ways to scam the American consumers and this was one of them! I don’t know who blocked my account! However, is there customer support to solve the issue?As a result I lost all my business emails and some of them were irreplaceable!I looked for another business email provider but first I could not transfer my domain email to the new one, because Microsoft had to release it and they would not! This luckily resolved in 24 hours as the new provider was able to get my domain name.But how can you stop Microsoft from taking the subscription payments out of your bank account in the future?Next, I called my bank and I told them to BLOCK Microsoft, so they could not take out another payment automatically. I also reported them to the FBI Cyber Crimes department hoping they are not too busy to do something about it.Next month on the second, I received an email from Microsoft saying they could not take the monthly fees out of my account! Of course, it is a “no-reply” email so I could not communicate with them.Be careful not to use unreliable, garbage email providers like Microsoft. My suggestion is to go with the small providers with customer service. Call them and talk to a live person. However, do not get too comfortable and keep copies of your emails! You may have to change providers more often then you would like to.",1,2023-03-02T05:43:13.000Z

Five of them asked me the same questions over & over; they weren't paying attention or reading what had already been tried or even believing what I was telling them.  (They're being paid for this??)

JaneBrunette,If I could I would give this review ZERO stars,"I would give this review a zero star if I could. It is impossible to get any help from Microsoft. Their customer service does not exist. I have spent four days trying to reach a live agent. Their Live Chat could not help me and directed me to 800-865-9408, where I spoke with a live agent in another country who did not understand my inquiry. Therefore, they could not help me and told me an agent would call me back. Four days later and they never did. Their phone numbers listed online — 800-642-7676 and 877-696-7786 — direct you back to their website. I do not have a technical question. It is a simple inquiry regarding my Office subscription. A subscription means I pay these people money. I reached out to them via their Facebook ""community"" page. They deleted my post. I contacted them on Twitter — I opened a Twitter account for this purpose. I have received no response on Twitter. They closed their Retail Stores therefore I am unable to speak to a person in real life. My hope is that Microsoft will eventually go the way of the Dodo bird. At least Apple has a retail option for customer service, and I can reach a live agent in the United States via their 800 number. We are living in a comical yet disgusting capitalistic bizarre moment in time. One which lends opportunity for another company to blow Microsoft out of the water.

Mikey,I'm giving them 2 stars only because…,"I'm giving them 2 stars only because the 1st level folks try really hard and are very polite. If your problem is simple, they probably will find an answer.Unfortunately, as a senior level Engineer, when I contact support my needs are always well beyond what a 1st level support tech can resolve. That's where things seriously break down.The first go-around of an escalation is generally the escalation engineer passing on a documentation link or two that don't apply, don't help, or contain errors. Even when I've provided very detailed information the first response from escalation engineer indicates no attempt was made to fully review the case so valid and helpful response can be provided. They seem to just push out a canned response based on case summery, hoping it will somehow stick.After customer re-explains the problem (and why the links provided don't help), escalation support takes a long time to get back. They seem to try not to engage directly with the customer if at all possible, leaving all back-and-forth communication filtering through 1st level support tech. This slows things down even more. Further, I find I often have to provide the same information multiple times -- maybe indicating the ticket is being passed around with new engineers failing to read history?In the end, I normally end up finding a solution on my own before Microsoft Support comes through. The only reason I bother opening a ticket is so I can check the box and answer ""yes, I have a support case open"" when asked.If Microsoft fixes the escalation path, their support could become much better.",2,2023-03-31T00:31:59.000Z

It was frustrating because I had to tell the same story of what happened every time I followed up on the progress. They kept saying the case was under management reviewed and expedited, but the result I got was asking to extend their investigation process another ten business days.

Chuck,Paid M365 poor support,"After using their M365 platform for my small business for almost a year now, needing assistance with Endpoint ( Intune ) had a device that would not update; I used their support ( I have a subscription ). The support team reached out to determine the problem. Via an email questionnaire (they were requested to call), I responded to the questions within 1 hour. The agent assigned to my case responded the next day, near his quit time, with two queries. And proceeded to email once a day for the following business days. On the sixth day, I was finally assigned to another agent after many calls to support. The new agent spoke with me on the phone and said he would get back to me in an hour, but no call happened. I resolved the issue that night and finished the following day. I emailed back in response to the email I was sent advising my disdain for the lack of service and the poor communication skills of the people involved. The second agent did call back after the email was sent; he at least attempted to assist; I could not recommend this company to anyone in good conscience. Six people on the original email from Microsoft were to monitor the issues never heard from one.

Following the instructions online, all seems pretty straight forward. Print a UPS delivery label, send controller back and await new or refurbished replacement, happy days, or so I thought.Weeks passed, and Microsoft has a convenient notice on their website stating"" Your package is at the service centreOrder status may not show that your package is at the service centre. Check back later.""Which is a really convenient usage of the English language which I think is intended to confuse customers.After weeks, I phoned up for them to confirm that, indeed my parcel has been received by Microsoft but they don't know where it is, so they need to locate it. Meanwhile, my replacement controller is put on hold until they locate this missing package.Another week passed, I'm still in the dark to where my controller is.Ups have an investigation open, Microsoft have an investigation open, upon contacting them again to try and get some clarity, I was then informed that they couldn't send a replacement controller over as I may be trying to commit fraud. People send empty boxes in on purpose.So not only have Microsoft or UPS lost my controller, they have the audacity to accuse their customers of theft in the process.This is an absolutely scandalous service, and I wish I'd have seen the trustpilot reviews earlier because I'd have stuck to playstation.",1,2023-03-14T14:07:27.000Z

Because of this the hackers had free acess to somehow change the email and password again.After searching for about 40 minutes I finally managed to find a way to chat with a real microsoft employee and after a 1 hour sessions they told me they knew I was the original account owner, but could not restore access to the account due to their policies...

Tamsyn Mott,-20 - minus 20 points/'stars',"-20 stars. Why aren't negative 'stars' possible? Being forced to give 1 star when Microsoft deserves huge minus points is extremely irritating.Microsoft just did their very best to stop me even using my computer today. They tried their very best to force me to sign up and give them financial details. WHY???? WHY on earth would I give such a useless and irritating company that has nothing, as far as I'm concerned, to do with finances any financial details at all????? The idea alone is disgusting. WHY would I trust THEM with any details about me at all??!!??Their very attempt to force me by making it as DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE to stop being forced to enter financial details has ensured that I will NEVER, EVER give them any financial, or indeed email, details - and if they have access to my email etc then I will immediately unsubscribe from anything to do with them.I already have extremely painful, irritating and never-ending problems as it is with microsoft word. Why on earth would I want to volunteer for presumably yet more problems by signing up to anything else they 'offer', especially when they try to FORCE PAYING CUSTOMERS to do something they don't want to do?I have so many problems with word that I wrote a terrible review, which they still deserve as some things are still completely awful to use, like bullet points, tables, columns, any page etc breaks, style choices - especially 'normal' style which is unbelievably awful, etc, and cause me endless trouble.As a result of the terrible review I ended up with a call from a microsoft engineer who was, apparently, supposed to 'help' me. Nothing he said helped me at all and was just yet another complete waste of time - as I sadly experience frequently using word because I have to waste lots of time trying to sort out the problems they continuously cause me.So being forced, very nearly, into giving microsoft completely unnecessary details like email, and especially my financial details has ensured that I WILL NOT EVER voluntarily give them any information that they try to force from me, as I already dislike word immensely but don't know of anything else I can use instead. Believe me, if I knew of an alternative to word, then I would try it immediately as word is absolutely terrible.",1,2023-02-01T11:40:10.000Z

Alocin,Microsoft Do Not Care About Hacking,"I have a microsoft 365personal account, and I wanted to change my password, which I've done several times in the past without issues.  However, this time the verification code was not being received on my mobile after several requests.So I looked at my account and saw that my country of origin was recorded as USA when infact I am in the UK.  I thought this may be the issue and changed the phone code (not the number to UK) but then decided to cancel the request and thought it may be better if I just change the country instead.  Microsoft emailed me to say change had been cancelled.  However, I still could not change any info on my account as I was not receiving the text message verification text.  Then after several online chats, I received an email from MS to say my account had been accessed from an IP address in USA and if it wasn't me I should change my password.  But I can't change my password as I'm not receiving the verification code!   Just going round in circles!   And since receiving the email to say my account was accessed by an IP in USA, everytime I try to change any details I receive a pop up telling me I've made a security change and my account is locked for 30 days!  But I cancelled my request so whoever is accessing my account in the US has obviously changed my account!   I've had approx 10 chat online support calls and nobody is doing anything about it!   I've been told to set up 2 step authorisation but I can't because again, it wants me to receive a code which does not arrive!So literally, I know my account is being hacked, Microsoft have emailed me to tell me my account was accessed in the USA, and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.   I've tried to report this so many times in the past 18 hours and I'm getting nowhere, just unbelievable.What am I supposed to do?  I still have my password but can't update any details to make my account safe again because someone else has made a security change on it, which is stopping me from updating my security.Online chat just keep sending me round in circles!",1,2023-01-11T16:51:00.000Z

It's apparently a well known JavaScript issue and the tech help should've known this and the fix for it.I find this disingenuous attitude from MS disgusting.

Anthea Vishegonov,"Good Product, TERRIBLE Customer Service","I have tried getting in touch with a live Microsoft representative for over an hour with no success. As a loyal Microsoft user, I am extremely disappointed. When I call Microsoft's customer service phone number, I am connected with an automated robot that tells me the Microsoft help website and disconnects the phone. The Microsoft help website is not helpful at all unless you are tech-savvy enough to understand the exact issue you are trying to resolve and can execute the instructions on a blog to get yourself back on track. Microsoft's customer help website does not give you the option of connecting with a live representative. I tried calling 3 different phone numbers I found online and unhelpful automated responses were the only answer. If you would like to speak with a live Microsoft representative to help you with your product issue, forget about it. Live help is not an option with Microsoft! It is a shame to know that I cannot count on Microsoft support. I do not know how much longer my loyalty to Microsoft will last.

With zero notice and zero communication Microsoft ads cancelled my account. They would not tell me why....after I contacted them they wouldn't tell me why and said that it is irreversible and final. Nobody else on the face of the earth does business this way why do they?? All they have to do is communicate with their customers but they don't. Why not tell me what I did wrong and allow me the opportunity to make corrections to the ad and then still make the revenue?

Templer Charter,I'd give it less then once if I could,"I'd give it less then once if I could . Gates has only made a huge amount of money selling a  less then sub standard product at a premium rate , with next to no practical use. I only wanted to download a free app from the store and the system demmanded I sign into the hotmail account I only created to set up my computer because I had no choice as the system forces you to. Because this user unfriendly system does not store passwords like apple in a user friendly way , I can understand a security lock to download and pay for non free stuff. However despite the fact that I passed the pin code it still wouldn't let me download a free app from the Microsoft Store , I never used Hotfail , it';s always full of click bait news that would have made the National Enquirer blush. Now I'm locked out of my microsoft account because I couldn't get to my file in my real office not a pretend one that these clowns purport to represent and get this rarely used info.  It was after midnight.  Scum bags if I had known that I could have downloaded the free up  by signing out of the store I would have just done that. However there was no prompt.  So in theroy if I ever wanted to set up a new store account the easiest thing would be to re set to factory settings and star over again entirely. Terrible saystems , support and wastes so mucn time being strong armed into signing up for certain products no option to by pass hotmail.

MN,"""Microsoft takes the security and privacy of our customers very seriously"" - No, they passively corner you to buy more software when you forget your Microsoft account Password.","For the past three-four days I have been trying to recover my Microsoft account password so I can use the Word, Excel, PowerPoint applications (on my MacBook) that I bought in 2019 (one off lifetime purchase, no subscription). But I keep getting the ""Unfortunately, our automated system has determined that the information you provided was not sufficient for us to validate your account ownership"".I emailed them ""What do I need to do in order to satisfy you people in order to use the software that I bought with my own money. I have the product key. I do not remember my Microsoft account password (I keep putting the same information on the form but my name and date of birth has not changed so I’m stuck! and I don't remember if I used my credit card or debit card in 2019 to buy it and I don't remember the numbers of these cards) and I’m trying to retrieve my account in order use the software that I bought. And now I have reached the limit to recover my own account.""I went to the MS store, they gave me a number to speak with a human. He stated the online account recovery method is the only way to recover a password. He instructed me to do it another way, which I am trying. No luck so far! Apparently your software purchase is forever with that one email address your MS account is associated with.Oh and according to the MS customer service, I can't even add my purchase and its unique product key code to another MS account I could create.Again, this was a 2019 purchase: I have don't the same credit and debit cards. Microsoft doesn't realise cards expire and people get new ones (which happened to me) and I think (like myself) people don't generally remember the numbers of old credit/debit cards. I don't remember what card I used to buy the software in 2019!Also, I wonder if Microsoft realises that people’s laptops can be stolen or can break down. This may be another issue on its way but what if Microsoft doesn’t have procedures where my ‘one off lifetime purchase, no subscription’ can’t be installed on a new computer I recently purchased?This is slowly leading towards a ‘shut up and cough up another £100-200 to buy the software again'.I live in the UK - the number I called to speak to a Human was 0800 026 0329.

MS 2021 is a form of malware. Its been as though I bought and installed malicious software. Basic default functions in copy and paste have been disabled, requiring work arounds, the P in any font is faint, like an old typewriter with a worn key, the Word format is now incompatible with almost everything - when I send an attachment it opens in gibberish for most people, including on my other laptop with Word 2010. The default opening to backscene instead of normal file view is another useless time wasting addition. The order of most functions on the tool bar has been changed for no apparent reason except to confuse - and the order of the functions within those boxes has been changed - again for no beneficial reason to the user. i can't save word documents from an email attachement - I have to open them in some bizarre pdf format and they save as some kind of Chrome file.

They finally sent me a replacement device, which was again fault. So now I am wasting my time to replace the replacement device.Microsoft should improve their system for providing support to their customers. And MUST hire people with some technical knowledge or at least give them proper training to understand technical issues.",1,2022-12-12T17:48:10.000Z

Mark Evans,Microsoft should be ashamed!!!,"My 14year old son wanted to purchase a game pack for one of his games cost £7.99. I told him if he wanted it he could pay for it himself, so added his bank card to his xbox account. Within 3 days 9 gift cards totalling £355 had been taken from his account which we did not find out about until we received his statement. I immediately contacted Microsoft but after explaining the problem and was put on hold, after 15 minutes on hold the call suddenly ended so I called again and explained again and was put on hold again. After about an hour and 15 minutes of explaining and going through the purchases the guy agreed that the transactions were fraudulent and said the money would be returned and he would ring me when this was going to happen. I waited a week and heard nothing so rang again only to be told by a totally disinterested guy it was still being investigated and I would have to wait. I said I would contact the bank and was basically told do what you want. I waited another 5 days and still heard nothing so I did ring the bank (Nat West) and was told by the fraud team that because Microsoft had said they were going to refund the money to get back onto them, and call again if they said they would not refund the money. I called Microsoft again when I got through i explained yet again and was put on hold while they looked into it only to be cut off yet again after 20 minutes, so I called again and spoke to another person who was even less interested than the first person but I did manage to get him to say they would not refund and to go through the bank but was put on hold again and once again the call was ended suddenly. I called the bank back and explained to them what had happened with Microsoft and to be fair to the bank they have refunded his money. I think Microsoft should be totally ashamed of there costumer services and need to look at there systems how buying 9 gift cards in 2 days doesn’t look like suspicious activity is beyond me but they were quite happy to leave a 14 year old out of pocket to fill there own, absolutely disgusting!!!",1,2022-12-09T01:40:01.000Z
Bill,Worse customer service ever!!,"12/8/22: Worse customer service experience I've ever had.  It's almost impossible to speak to someone live, most is done via chat.  I got bounced around from one ""technical expert"" to another on chat.    Spent around 8 hours total on chat and the phone, with no problem resolution.  I was made promises that never happened (i.e.. ""Tier II will contact you today"", ""problem will be resolved today"", ""you should get a refund and I'll connect you to billing"", etc.).  So many things promised, and none materializing.  The Microsoft support I received is a disgrace.  I truly believe their main goal, if they can not fix an issue, is to keep transferring you around until you get fed up and leave.  I don't know what else to do about this.  Very hopeless.....12/12/22:  tried again today against my better judgement.  Same thing, getting passed around.  Got a new link given to me, in which someone is supposed to be calling me (not holding my breath).  Now it's not the extra money I lost paying for an unlimited version of Microsoft Office (with no weekly/monthly fees), it's the principle now.  I'm going to keep trying until refunded or fixed.  If I ever get the ""secret formula"" on how to resolve Microsoft issues, I'll pass it on.",1,2022-12-12T19:06:57.000Z

Lorne Tyczenski,Microsoft Horrible Service,"I have had a few Surface tablets over the years including the very first model, all worked fine. Since then, I have had laptops from many different companies with varying quality etc. It was time for a new laptop so I thought I would try Surface again, big mistake. I bought the Surface Pro 8 with i7-1185G7 @ 3.00GHz   3.00 GHz; 16 gigs RAM and a 256gig SSD. It seemed to be acting a bit ""strange"" from the beginning, but I thought it was me adjusting to this tablet. Well, it all went downhill from there. I contacted Microsoft support a few times, they had me re-install Windows a few times but every time a new issue would come up. After several support sessions they said that the hardware was defective, and I needed to have a replacement. I thought that was ok until they said it would be a used ""reconditioned"" unit that would function perfectly. Having had ""reconditioned"" units in the past I knew that I was just acquiring someone elses issues. Plus, I had only had the unit for just over two months! So, I said that I would rather upgrade to a different model and pay the difference. Because this had gone on so long the 60-day period for return/exchange had passed. I was told by one agent that Microsoft had a trade-in program, so I checked it out. The amount that Microsoft wanted to give me for two-and-a-half-month-old Surface was $180!!! I paid over $2000 for it. My issue and request was sent to a ""team"" and they said because my Surface was bought 90 days ago, I would only receive a used unit and no return and upgrade. Needless to say, I said no and will relegate it to the few things that it can still do. I would never buy a Micrsoft product again. Over the years I have been a loyal customer and apologist of theirs. I've had many Surface units, countless Microsoft laptops from many different manufacturers, three Surface phones (remember them?) etc. They have made clear that they have no interest in customer service, all they want is our money and get lost.",1,2022-09-18T21:08:54.000Z

Furthermore, their products do not actually work very well but they don't seem to care about that either.

That was 9:30AM. It is now 4pm, I have still not heard from my doctor.I contacted Microsoft aprox 3pm, it is now 4pm and got a phonecall in 2 minutes and help was not only technical, it was also personal.I was stressed out and the rep was calm, collected and supercool in the face of a disorganized mind trying to verbalize my problem. I was taken out of my state of stress and the issue was found.Microsoft and Blake spent 52 mins on the phone with me. The issue me took more time then the technical issue. I am so grateful.I will forever trust Microsoft with all my data and knowing that if I manage to tie them in a knot they are there to help me untie it.Thank you to all the reps I have talked to.I do hope you pay them well Microsoft, they are worth their weight in conflict-free/ethical diamonds and should be treated accordingly so they shine not only at work, but in life.You should have plenty of salt on your ample dinner table after a convo with me!",5,2022-08-31T16:17:50.000Z

JT,Missing Item and poor escalation policy,"I recently ordered a Surface Pro and mouse via Microsoft. Both items were delivered by DPD (handed to the building concierge) but the envelope containing the mouse was empty. I contacted DPD, the courier who told me that I have to contact the provider. After speaking to a Microsoft customer service advisor I was advised I could buy a new mouse (which was promptly delivered by UPS) while an investigation was underway regarding the lost item, so I could be subsequently refunded. I was asked to send photos of the empty envelope which I did and from the outset I was clear that I wasn’t accusing the DPD courier of foul-play and that in fact the envelope wasn’t damaged, it was merely not sealed so the item could have easily fallen out by accident (so likely a packaging fault at the warehouse). I am now informed that the investigation has concluded that the courier delivered the parcel as normal and so I am not liable for any refund. I am not going to argue and escalate further for the sake of £27, when I had already parted with hundreds more by purchasing the laptop itself (also after contacting the team to flag this up today it is clear the customer service them are saying the case is closed and it is beyond their control as the escalation team has concluded that DPD delivered the parcel as normal) but I take great offence in an investigation policy that essentially is just a matter of client word Vs courier word (or in this case our photos which just show the outside of an envelope) when it will never be in the interest of Microsoft to find the customer in the right as that equates to their monetary loss.",1,2022-11-15T19:09:45.000Z

So I contacted Microsoft to end the Microsoft 365 Subscription, which was ended mostly by MYSELF. Long story short, they cancelled my subscription, then refused to issue a refund despite me being within my right to do so. They constantly put me on hold, hung up on me twice, then kept me going in a game of telephone between various departments while telling me it's the bank's fault (WHICH IT ISN'T).

Dawn Armstrong,"Charged Twice, No Refund from Microsoft.","My husband ordered Microsoft 365 Family on his account and paid for it. 3 days later the same amount was billed to my Microsoft account without my authority. I didn't pick that up until recently whilst doing our tax return (3 months later). What a fiasco trying to contact anyone. Their phone numbers just go to generic messages saying to go to their website. You go there and there is NO HELP whatsoever, complete run around. They basically have shut off most avenues of contact. After days of trying everything I finally got a consultant via phone. They were NO HELP at all so I had it escalated to the manager 'Bella' who also informed me they couldn't do a refund after 1 month. When I explained they had illegally taken funds from our credit card without my authorisation they said they still wouldn't give a refund but that I should submit a complaint to their Complaints team. I requested a reference number and asked Bella to email it to me along with the details of the conversation we had been having so I had proof to put to the Complaints team or to the Commerce Commission. She said she would do that but it would take a quarter of an hour to send through to me. I said I was happy to stay on our call and wait for it to come through to my email. I also asked if we got cut off (I'm in NZ) would she call me back, she affirmed she would. 1 minute later the call ended and I never heard back from her nor did I receive any email. For the life of me I can not find any email address for 'Complaints', I don't believe that even exists. If it did I think they know it would get SO flooded their systems would overload and wouldn't cope, they'd end up as frustrated and angry as their own customers.

They send me a link to reset but somehow they can't use my phone number and they can't send the code at all so I keep getting stuck. At this one point I reach out via email they send me some information that I cannot download and I disclose that to them they keep sending it I cannot download it I'm still locked out of my account 4 days later. Now I would like a refund.

All I needed to know is why the money is back in my account. Does that take 5 phone calls, 1h on hold, and 'transferral to higher staff for investigation'? What a joke. Workers barely speak English, one of them almost cancelled my order because they thought I WANTED my money back.

This is the third time recently that an automatic Microsoft Windows 10 64 bit automatic update has wrecked my computers. The previous two times I was able to reinstall everything which took a week both times; this time the screen is black, nothing is working although power is getting to the laptop. I did everything which Microsoft Support advised (tried multiple solutions – to no avail). I also tried repair cd’s, recovery setup cd’s, Windows 10 64 bit installation CD – nothing is working. You can’t even get into the BIOS System for recovery!I have been using licenced purchased Microsoft Products for over 30+ years (right back to Windows 3.1 & MS Dos 5 to present day) and always recommended and used Licenced Microsoft products and operating systems on all  my work computers (Local Government and my own personal machines).There is nothing wrong with my hardware, it is a Microsoft Windows Software Automatic Update Problem which Microsoft should fix, as it is was responsible for the problem. I wish to strongly point out that I am not looking for compensation, just for Microsoft to get my laptop up and running again or at least have the decency to have the laptop Licenced Microsoft Software / Operating System fixed. So if you could get some of your Master Programmers to email me a working solution. My laptop is an essential means for me to communicate with family and for my work.As previously mentioned it is a Microsoft Windows Software problem not a hardware problem.Please do not close the case incident until you resolve the problem. Microsoft have the best Programmers in the world so this glitch in Microsoft’s Software should be easy to fix for yourselves.I await your solution at your earliest convenience.Thank you very much for your help in this matter, much appreciated.Kind Regards,Brian Walkington",1,2022-06-27T12:39:40.000Z

I have found that support does not seem to understand what the issues are about, and are not able to help as much as previously.

Bruce B.,Microsoft services…,"I have multiple Microsoft services associated with my Microsoft account that encompasses two home user offerings (Office 365 Family and Xbox Live Gold) and one business offering (Office 365 Business).Having followed all guides to migrate these services between jurisdictional regions, I am unable to move the billing.Apparently this is because I pay for a year in advance and as there is a credit of service validity (not money), this is blocked.I have to wait until this service validity expires in order to change the region and setup payment in the new region.As the services have different expiry dates, this means losing access to the service or perform an international transaction across the regions just to keep one service active until another is ready to expire.All this effort, potential loss of service, and additional international charges across jurisdictions are simply because the region cannot be updated by Microsoft and I, as the account owner cannot change this either.This is all beside the fact that the jurisdictional location of an account is a legal requirement on the business account and should any data be breached, this brings into play GDPR where I will be held liable for an account domiciled outside the EU.Microsoft does not follow Trustpilot, but just sharing with fellow reviewers as this is the second time I am having problems with their services and can confirm that even having business support where you can chat or call their support does little to help.There is little value left in remaining with them and while painful, maybe it is time to consider alternative companies that care about their customers.",1,2022-08-26T11:51:51.000Z

Claire C,Stay Clear of Microsoft,"I have contacted microsoft on numerous occasions for my refund from the 13th June 2022. Yes, a month I have been waiting. I am sick and tired of doing the running around to be fobbed off all the time.I have done everything that has been asked including sending photos in to prove that my refund has not been returned. Having to explain myself every time that I contact Microsoft because services do not respond to each other, to also be told I can not speak to anyone higher than them because they only communicate through emails is disgusting. I have been told to give them 24hrs for them to get back in touch, but nooooo people are not capable of picking the phone up and speak to someone to help deal with this issue, the customer has to ring back instead. Maybe I should start charging for my time.Finally, I manage to find a number for the UK to then discuss with a member of the team a case number that she was at the time able to read to be told by her manager that they don't deal with cases beginning with 10, they only deal with cases beginning 70. I do not recommend any of the services microsoft have to offer.Now £60 is not a lot of money for your company, well it is for me and especially with the living costs at the moment some of us can't afford certain amounts to just be brushed off.",1,2022-08-16T11:33:30.000Z

I double and triple checked the web address of the chat and it appeared to be legit, but they were doing a damn good impression of a low-level scam artist. It also took forever to get chat responses from the service rep. And the chat software had a glitch that caused my messages to sometimes appear and sometimes not appear after I sent them. I had tried calling as well and the automated service wasted my time and then informed me that I couldn’t speak to a person about the charge.

Laura MacMillan,I wish I could rate lower than a 1/5,"I wish I could rate lower than a 1/5. I ordered a Surface Pro 7+ bundle back in March 2022 with the type cover keyboard being shipped in mid-May 2022. While FedEx lost the type cover package, I have contacted Microsoft customer support five separate times to handle the issue. They kept blaming FedEx, however, they did not offer a solution to resolve my problem. I did everything that they told me including filing a claim with FedEx on June 2 which FedEx sent to Microsoft to approve and no response so the file was closed 3 weeks later. I had to reopen the file with FedEx and try calling back Microsoft to approve it. I have asked Microsoft several times if they could resend the type cover and they said that they could not each time. I asked to speak with a supervisor and they said someone would call me back within 10 minutes and then another 3 weeks went by with no phone call. Then they told me they would give me a reference number for a credit towards the type cover which is not in stock and they do not know when it will be back in stock. They said that I need to keep checking back and call when it is available to reorder. I asked them if they could just send one to me once it is back in stock, however, they said that they would not do that. I have wasted so much time and it has been over two months since the package was lost and dealing with Microsoft. They are not helpful and this is a very upsetting experience. I am going to return my surface and go buy an Apple instead. I have always been an Android person, but at this point, I want to get rid of all Microsoft products.",1,2022-07-21T00:08:43.000Z

John H,No longer ‘free’ to use Excel & Word!!,"I have enjoyed free access to Excel & Word, until I made the mistake of upgrading my iPad Air 9.7” screen to an iPad 10.2” screen. The upgrade was made as I no longer received iOS software updates due to the age of the iPad Air. Once I had upgraded and transferred all my data and apps from one to the other I found that Excel & Word was no longer free and I was being asked to sign into my Microsoft account with a subscription to update the spreadsheets and other documents. Apparently, I decision was made by Microsoft that any device with greater than 10.1” screen size would now have to pay a subscription. This has never been pointed out to me, and I am obviously on their email mailing list, as I have received comparatively recent emails from them regards terms and conditions etc. I raised this matter directly with a Claire Barclay, who I understand is CEO for Microsoft UK, on 18 May, and it has still not been resolved, and I have no great hope of this happening any time soon, certainly in my favour.

On top of that when I returned the controller to microsoft I returned it in its original packaging with all its accessories, (as purchased) when I recieved the replacement all they sent back was a controller no accessories and no original packaging!! so even if the controller I was returned was functioning properly I still can't use it as you need the accessories to use the controller. So with that in mind! I contacted Microsoft about this, why have they not returned what I sent?... when speaking to there customer services they bascilly said ""sorry sir but unfortunately we will not be returning everything you sent to us as the fault was only with the controller its self"" ABSOLUTLY OUTRAGEOUS...

So today I did some more investigations and found that the problem was my partners laptop. So I started investigating her laptop and found out that windows 11 basically uses a torrent style system where other users updating their windows 11 will take parts from your windows 11 update. I had to manually disable the uploading feature and stop it using all my bandwidth. My 150mb fttp was down to 10mbps. Most people don't even know this is happening to them and Windows 11 and microsoft should be boycotted until they remove this Windows update file sharing!,1,2022-05-04T18:52:21.000Z

Jacob Newhart,Incompetent joke,"This is one of the worst experiences I have ever had with tech support at a supervisor level. I recently had an issue with Microsoft where I canceled a subscription through them. I canceled it many months ago and no longer had access to it. At this point, I thought I was finished, I no longer could use the service, so I naturally assumed everything was fine. Fast forward a few months, and I was looking through my bank transactions when I realized that a payment to Microsoft had come out that shouldn't have. I looked up the same transaction type, and it turned out I had been paying for it for the last 5 months. After 30 minutes of phone trees, chat bots, and then a second phone call, I got a hold of a tech that basically couldn't solve my problem and made me wait two days for a call from a supervisor at 7:19pm. When I explained that I had canceled the service and had no access to it, so I was confused why I had been charged for months, he genuinely told me the following mind-numbing statements.""If you didn't have access to it, why didn't you call us?"" (Clearly showing he didn't understand or didn't care about the details of the problem)""When I have a subscription, I make sure to cancel it. (Basically, calling me stupid for not seeing the charges sooner.)""All transactions are final. It doesn't matter if you didn't have access to the service. "" (I couldn't even process this statement.)After this amazing display of customer service, he oh so generously offered me a single month's refund, even though I canceled my subscription months ago and couldn't even use it if I wanted to. This offer was basically the end of the conversation, and he wouldn't let me talk to him anymore. He would just repeat that he had other customers to help, everything had been explained to me already, and if I didn't want the one month's refund, then I didn't get anything and the conversation was over.So in conversation, great job. Microsoft, you strung me along for DAYS at your leisure just to tell me that you had no problem stealing my money from me and were in a hurry to move on to the next person.",1,2022-03-09T02:18:55.000Z

I provided proof of my email requesting a refund only to be told this email address isn’t monitored.No where did it say this email address wasn’t being monitored or that you should not reply.Appalling customer service.Poorly designed website designed to prevent people from finding a means of contacting the team.,1,2022-04-28T09:52:43.442Z

I am about to become the 2,177th. This is why ...I have a serious problem with Windows 10 (completely legitimate ""no shortcuts"" version).  I'm willing to pay a premium price for help - but it's simply not there. Online searches for Microsoft's help led me round and round in endless repetitive circles. I finally devised keywords ""Buy Windows Premium Technical Support"" which appeared to have broken me out of the roundabout - but no. I'm desperate for some help, the need for which which has arisen despite being totally up to date with updates. I'm ready to pay almost any sum for some help. The site Microsoft gave me said I was number 3 in line for some support, but I'm still number 3, after four hours. It's plainly a straightforward fraudulent lie. This is the third time in 18 months that I've gone through similar experiences - I HATE Microsoft now.

No email access,One Drive Issues,After months of incorrect tech advice regarding my One Drive I emailed a complaint to microsoft. I did then get sensible help on several long (1 hour plus support calls) by a One Drive specialist. I still had issues but it was then (by Microsoft) decided it wasn't a Microsoft problem. I was told to email ( contacting the specialist) if I had any further problems. I constantly get kicked out of One Drive for no apparent reason on laptop and phone and am told to re create the account which then duplicates all my photos and documents which are already stored.

Not!  After this thoroughly frustrating and seemingly unattainable pursuit I filled out a form and submitted by email.  I received an answer in due course advising an agent would be assigned to my case and be in contact soon.  The assigned agent sent me an email in due course and directed me to fill out a new form using Microsoft Word answering a few questions and providing more information.  Most of the questions on the form were irrelevant and not applicable, even not answerable.  The request for information would have produced a tome of data, much of it personal.  I responded that I could not even retrieve much of the information they were asking for and it included personal information that would be unwise for me to give to anybody.

Keep in mind this system was left in the rain and they didn’t have someone sign for it when it’s worth 500 usd. I was on the phone for over 4 hours and kept getting hung up in by the “support”.

Kate,Microsoft/Currys - unethical business practices,"Microsoft and Currys are partners in crime. Do not trust either of them.

When she started to use it, she received an electric shock every time she touched it. She went back to Currys who said they couldn't do anything and she would have to deal directly with Microsoft. They said Microsoft won't deal with them, they have to deal with the customer direct. This, in spite of her consumer contract being with Currys. Strange arrangement but it enables them both to avoid their consumer responsibilities. Long story short, eventually Microsoft sent a replacement laptop. Unbeknownst to her this was a refurbished laptop!!! In my opinion this is a shocking deception by a major company. This refurbished laptop has an intermittent fault. Back to Currys who again refused to do anything. Microsoft have offered to repair or sort it out but...my daughter has ended up paying an excessive amount of money for a malfunctioning laptop and has ended up with a refurbished one which is still faulty. How can this be fair????? We are in the process of taking Currys and  Microsoft to the small claims court and we are complaining to Which. Don't touch Currys or Microsoft  with a bargepole.

Dylan,"Horrid support, lies, and a malfunctioning device.  Welcome to the Microsoft experience.","My foster daughter, a university student living with a disability who requires a laptop with specialized software to do her work, purchased a Surface laptop 3 through the online Microsoft store, and after speaking with an agent at Microsoft I insisted that she get the extended warrantee, as they told us that it allowed her to receive a replacement if there was a problem  and then send the old unit back after receiving it.  The rep said it was much faster to do it this way, and gave us the chance to transfer files off of the machine.About a week ago she turns on the laptop and the keyboard doesn't work.  It has never been dropped or treated I went online to try various fixes from forums (this is a very common issue) none of them work.Called Microsoft support and they took me through various steps to try to fix it.  As a last ditch effort, they had me reset the machine, and reinstall windows.  The keyboard still did not work.The tech took our mailing address, told us he was sending out a replacement.  We would have three days to transfer personal files off the old machine.  I was told he would send a confirmation email with all of the details including the shipping info and case number, and that the replacement would arrive within 4 days.He asked me to do a phone survey after he hung up to give him a good review; which I did as I was happy at the time with the support.After 5 days, I had not received any email, or the laptop, so I called back.  I was told by the tech that no order had been created. There was a record of the conversation though,so I thought it could be straightened out.  I was then told that I would have to send the laptop back first, wait for it to be serviced, and sent back.  I asked about how long that would take, and the tech could not give me a timeline.The tech said that they would ask their supervisor if an exception could be made.  After waiting several minutes on hold, they came back and told me a new unit would be sent out, and we could send the old one back after we received it.  They took our shipping information again, and put me on hold again for several minutes.When they returned to the call, they told me that a hold would be placed on my daughter's credit card for $2712.00.  This was not part of the previous arrangement.  When I pointed this out, the tech said there was nothing they could do.  When I pointed out that this amount was beyond the limit on her credit card, I was again told that there was nothing they could do, and since the card would not cover the amount, I was told that this was no longer an option.I asked to speak to a supervisor, and was placed on hold for around 10 minutes.  The tech returned and told me that there was no supervisor available, and even if there was they would tell me the same thing.  I said I wanted to speak to a supervisor.  The tech said she could arrange to have one call me back 'within 24 hours'.  Given how things had gone so far, I was fairly certain that was not going to happen.So,  I now had only one option.  I had to send the unit back to be inspected and repaired and wait however long that process took to receive it back.  I asked how long that process would take.  The tech told me ""2 to 4 days"".  That sounded like BS to me, so I asked again.  ""A few days to a week.""  I pointed out that shipping the unit to them would likely take a couple of days at least, never mind whatever they needed to do and then shipping it back.  ""Maybe probably a couple of weeks, estimate.""  I pointed out that this wasn't an answer, but the tech insisted that it's the best she could do.  I asked if she really had any idea how long it would take, and the tech would not answer.Given that I was being told that I had no other option, I was pretty frustrated.  I pointed out that when we bought the unit, we purchased the warantee after speaking with an agent about what the warantee got us.  We were told that if there was a problem we would have telephone support, and if it couldn't be fixed we would be sent a new unit, and then send the old unit back in the same box using the label in the box.  I also pointed out that the last tech I spoke to said the same thing.  I also pointed out that because a the tech I spoke to was legally a representative of the company, the promises he made were made by the company, and they were legally bound to honor them.  The tech said she ""understood my feelings"" but that there was nothing she could do.  I pointed out that I was expressing facts, not feelings.  She again said there was nothing she could do.  I asked what I had paid for in the warantee.  She said I got to return my malfunctioning device.Since it was obvious I had no other way to resolve the issue. I asked the tech to send a shipping label so I could send the unit back.  I was placed on hold for well over 20 minutes.I now have a label, and get to cross my fingers that they actually admit receiving it.  No call yet from a supervisor.",1,2022-02-22T17:30:00.000Z

Dan Thomas,Purchased a Microsoft Surface Book 2…,"Purchased a Microsoft Surface Book 2 back in 2019 for the figure of £2,350. From the start I had issues such as my wrists being electrocuted while on charge (Microsoft are aware of these products electrocuting its users, I have a ton of emails from them confirming this issue). You'll find that once you purchase you'll only ever be offered a replacement product for a lovely sum of money.I am only 2 and a half years into owning my device and already the cells have died and the device is now redundant and completely unusable. The repairability of these devices are rated 1/10. The chargers are made to be repeatedly replaced. I have reverted back to my Samsung 7 Series laptop which is around 10 years old and still works with its original charger!I will never waste another penny on Microsoft Products and I highly advise anyone reading this to go and look somewhere else, the level of support from Microsoft is somewhat equivalent to TalkTalk or McDonald's (useless).",1,2022-02-15T11:22:50.000Z

I’ve spent so much time on the phone with different people through microsoft. They keep hanging up, and when I try to call back, Microsoft tells me I’ve reached my daily limit of calling. Maybe I wouldn’t need to call so many times if the call would stay going, or if they would call me back, but whatever. They’ve made times with me to call me back because they tell me the process will take hours to complete, and they don’t call. I wait around and they don’t call. Then, tonight they tell me there’s nothing they can do, even though the person before them wanted to run a two hour scan on my computer - the only reason this didn’t happen was because they never called me back. I can’t believe how much of a headache it is trying to get support on my issue. They’ve told me to go purchase an ethernet cable in order for them to help (with an adapter I’ve spent over 60 dollars now, and it didn’t solve the problem) now my last option is paying for repair and diagnostics at a computer shop. This is so pathetic, I honestly feel embarrassed to have a Windows computer now.",1,2022-01-14T03:40:21.000Z
Julia Merrell,Best Customer Service I Have EVER Experienced,"I received the best customer service ever across all companies from an employee named Vishal.

For our first call, he showed me how to use the cut button instead which I was happy with. Then, I also asked him to fix an app that was not automatically opened when I clicked a file specific to it. He fixed it all flawlessly and I was content with it but he wanted to check up on me next week.I nearly blow him off the week after because I didn't have anymore concerns but he was adamant about helping me. Turns out, he has been studying how to incorporate the ""move to"" button back into file explorer. I honestly didn't think it was possible and I just hoped it would get added in the next update. However, he did some crazy file explorer coding and typed in crazy numbers and letters, restarted my laptop, and there is was. I very nice ""move to"" button back where I wanted it.

Dave Porter,Is Microsoft Making Fatal Business Decisions?,"This is the first time I have entered the 'Alice-in-Wonderland' world of Microsoft support.Initially I was trying to verify a website that was offering free older Windows 10 operating system   ISO's.Unfortunately, Microsoft only offers a solitary Windows 8.1  ISO on its 'up-front' download catalogue.All the Windows 10  ISO's are archived but you have to have a paid subscription to Microsoft's VLSC in order to access them...even if you have purchased software and a product key.The website I wanted to verify could have been offering counterfeit Microsoft products for all I knew or they could have been valid downloads from the Microsoft VLSC... but it was also in Microsoft's interest to clarify this.The counterfeit software report, I filed, has now been sitting with Microsoft at a status of only 'submitted' for nearly 2 weeks.Contacting Microsoft Support for online chats has resulted in a succession of broken promises to give priority to the issue.The only conclusion I can come to is that this outsourced Microsoft support organisation is taking money from Microsoft for doing absolutely nothing.I get the feeling, when talking to them, that I have more technical knowledge than the customer service representatives.It makes you wonder if they owe their positions there to nepotism and forged qualifications?I also wonder if Bill Gates has any idea what is going on with his company... and the fact that its reputation is fast going down the pan?",1,2021-11-07T08:33:37.000Z

I am making a follow up regarding your previous contact here at the Microsoft Store.As we aim to resolve your concern with us, we are making a follow up in regards to the cancelled Xbox Wireless Controller that you have purchased along the Xbox Series S Bundle. We came to identify that the automatic cancellation of the order is due to the Xbox Series S bundle promotion being incorrectly built at the time you were completing the purchase. The Xbox Series S bundle was originally offered to come with a single FREE Xbox Wireless Controller, however due to some technical issue, customers were able to add more than the supposed to be ONE - Xbox Wireless Controller.With this said, Microsoft have taken the necessary steps to correct these orders and ensure that the right promotion or products are delivered to the customers as part of the bundle, reason why you have ONE of the Xbox Wireless Controllers cancelled. Unfortunately, we will no longer be able to ship this item to you as that is not how the order/promotion is supposed to be delivered. We apologize for the confusion and the inconvenience this had caused you.On the other hand, if you feel like this purchase is something that did not match and/or something that you did not need given the promotion being incorrect when you made the purchase, you may request for a return and refund as you may be guaranteed with a full refund following the Microsoft Store's terms and policy for returns.Lastly, as we aim to resolve this issue, all cancelled orders will no longer be shipped while the rest that has been delivered are as well something that you can keep and consider it as part of your purchase, otherwise you may seek help for a return request. We ask for your understanding in this matter.If you have questions, feel free to respond back on this email and I shall respond back to you as soon as possible to lessen the hassle of you chatting us back, I can always assist personally if need be.Have a good day and thank you for choosing Microsoft Store.With Kind Regards,Errin B.Microsoft Customer Service Manager",1,2022-01-11T11:30:03.000Z

Draven Trent,There are no words.,"There are no words.My email of 15+ years that's tied to my banking, Xbox, subscription services, etc, was recently compromised by someone in Egypt.I got an email about unusual sign-in activity from Egypt, so I went to outlook.com to prevent the scammers/hackers from changing my password and stealing my account, but its been almost a decade since I've updated any security info, (10+yo phone number, no password changes in 9 years, bad I know).So when I tried to update my password it tried to send a message to a phone I haven't had in years, so I clicked the ""I don't have any of these"" button, where it prompted me to use a secondary email. When I entered my secondary email, it LOCKED ME OUT OF MY ACCOUNT FOR 30 DAYS WHILE THE CHANGES TOOK PLACE AND PREVENTED ME FROM MAKING ANY CHANGES TO MY ACCOUNT.About 10 minutes after being locked out of my account, my password was changed, presumably by the Egyptian guy, and I had to go through the ""account recovery"" process.The account recovery asked me for my birthdate, my card number, xbox device Id, contact list, recently sent emails, etc. BUT, because of how young I was when I made the account, I put in a random birthday that said I was older than I actually was, and I couldn't remember the date. Because of this; after 3 attempts, the Account Recovery locked me out of any more attempts, now I had to deal with tech support.The tech support speaks poor English, refuses to answer direct questions, and treats you like your stupid, posting links to the conversation that you've already seen and doesn't help you.They ""escalated"" my case 5 times and not once did it ever help me. They were unresponsive to emails and didn't provide any updates on my account. Its been 4 days now, 6 different chat sessions, 20+ emails, 3 separate chats with the ""supervisor"" and I still don't have my account back.

Terry Thone,Chicken bones and voodoo,"For 1 week MS data protection team has been informing me that they will call me to enable my Windows logon password/PIN.  Called in 10 times today and when they tried to ""supposedly"" transfer me the line is mysteriously disconnected.The last MS ""assistant"" literally had roosters crowing so loud I had a hard time understanding her broken english.  Tech support in general has become horrible in every tech business from cell, web hosting and now MS.We pay US money ($20 per hour at Mcdonalds) for MS windows business support and get $.50 and hour roosters crowing tech support that repeatedly hangs up after going though 50 versions of verification.  I feel like I'm trying to fill my car with gas and I have to answer if I want a car wash, pop, oil change, zip code verification and offer my first born to get the fuel pump to pump gas.Good customer service no longer exists with cell phone, MS, hospitals, and business in general.  It's like I've entered the twilight zone and American customer service is a distant dream.I guess the new MS tech support uses chicken bones and voodoo for the new and improved tech support.

AJ Thorn,Worst service I have had in a long time,"The first agent I spoke to was indeed very helpful I explained to him that I could not reset my password on my Xbox account because the automated system would not let me. Because I had tried so many times I decided to contact them directly. He then transferred me over to the accounts department stating that they can help me. I then proceeded to sit on hold for 20 mins which under normal circumstances I would not complain except when I finally got a hold of a person who told me they could only send me back to the website, the same website that has caused all of these problems. Microsoft security is for the lack of better word trash and needs to be fixed immediately. I am only giving 2 stars because the first agent was actually helpful",2,2022-01-05T20:18:15.000Z

Left it another week, no update, wait.Terrible, I'm down £500 with no idea if my purchase is coming. If I cancel I'll be stuck with £500 xbox credit.

Tom Patierno,Microsoft customer support is garbage,"I was trying to delete headers in a workbook in Excel.  None of the suggested steps on the first 2 results in Google (~20 pages) worked.  I called customer support.  I got some guy who just answered with a ""Hello,"" barely spoke English, then told me I needed to be an administrator to get an answer to this question.  Ridiculous.The second person on the phone answered with a ""Hello this is (XYZ) how can I help you?""  She also spoke fluent English.  That helped my mood quite a bit, but she also insisted that I needed to have an administrator do up a support ticket.  To ask a question about how change a stupid formatting thing in Excel?I went on the website to get help on the browser chat.  My place in line was 150.  2 hours later, it was 25.  I had been holding off on a bathroom break for 2 hours at that point, so I went to the bathroom at 2:03.  I came back at 2:07, and in that time someone had responded to my ticket and closed it due to my being inactive for three minutes.In that time, I could have copy/pasted everything into a completely new workbook, formatted everything just the way I like it, and had time to go run a few laps around the office.  I understand outsourcing to call centers in India or Ghana is cheaper, but it invariably leads to frustration.

Tried to call Microsoft support who had me load up Windows 10 Pro default key while cycling my internet off then on after 10% load. This lead to Window 10 Pro being installed but now have no active windows account. After running the troubleshooter and restarting my computer many many times at the instruction from the support team, no change to the activation status. This lead to me getting transferred to the next level of support. He gain access to my computer using quick assist and had no luck in fixing my problem. Then again transferred to the next level. Tried the same troubleshooting method with using the windows media tool to get back to windows home. Was told to receive a refund in 3 to 5 days. Then was told I had 2 options to spend an extra $100 for the mistake of the first support team help. This was explained, ""If he did not have me try to upgrade with Windows 10 Pro default key and we could have just refunded and bought the same $99 upgrade"". So after 3 and half hours I had 2 choices pay an extra $100 for someone else's mistake or reformat my hard drive and run the windows media tool that I used to install window home in the first place.

Stay away from them, there are better free software out there that do the same job if not better. Never again will I do business with this worst company ever!",1,2021-09-30T15:17:07.000Z

Anyway, somehow the office got locked out 3 months later and I cannot use it. Been contacting their customer support for nearly a month- they were absolute time wasters- had to repeat the issue every time, they repeated the same useless advice and eventually pass you on to someone else. They promise to contact you/ solve the problem and nothing ever happens. Tried calling their helpline which might as well not exist- just a recorded message telling you to go to their help page. I wouldn't use office if I had the choice. now with this kind of appalling service and the product isn't even worth it!",1,2021-10-26T09:49:28.000Z
RifRaf,No MS customer phone support,"No MS customer phone support?Are you kidding me?20+ years ago I did Microsoft Support for Windows XPH/XPP, and other MS products for Tier2 , Tier3, and then callbacks (escalations). Was a great job, had back-end KB article access, and learned a lot.Then they started moving support to India. They didn't care about the complaints for these new ""techs"". They didn't care they couldn't speak english and customers were frustrated. First it was the night shift and then soon the day shift. Soon the North American techs were stressed from trying to work with the over-seas techs. Once it got really bad (moving all support to India) I jumped ship and moved on to another job.I see now their support is 10X as bad.  No phone support!  Are you kidding me!  I admin several small businesses and they spend thousands on MS.  When we have an issue there is no MS support.  They do not care people.  They didn't care 20 years ago when they sent the support across seas to unqualified support techs.  They point you to endless articles and online forums to solve your issue, what a joke.  They push people to online services (office 365 etc.), force you to use a MS account to install their products and then provide ZERO support if you have an issue, warranty, defective product, etc.  It would be great if I could just buy a product and use a key (no login required, no subscription, etc.) but nope, let's move everything to the MS Store which is horrible.Start looking elsewhere folks.  Unless you are a business owner, purchasing business yearly plans, you have no support.  And I've worked with the big businesses too, their support is just as bad. They get call backs promptly but the techs are uneducated.Horrible Microsoft!",1,2021-10-25T13:32:22.000Z

Kursten Camp-Garduno,If I could give it a zero,"If I could give it a zero, I would. I sat up here at my desk for 2 hours and 4 different people trying to get somebody to figure out why my brand new Surface Laptop Go would download but not install the Microsoft PC Health Check app so I could see if I was gonna be able to get the Windows 11 update. After finally just giving up on Microsoft Support and them adding and unadding many admin profiles to my computer, I finally figured out on my own what it was. I had to swap out of S-Mode to install it because it is not an app in the Microsoft App store. Something as simple as a few clicks of a button to get it out of S-Mode so I could install what I needed. Why didn't they just make the health check app an actual free app in the store because it is free already, i dont know. But they're IQs over there can't be that great.

Marie Kennedy,No Customer Support,"I have Microsoft live email.  Suddenly I could not get into it.  I spent over an hour to try to find some sort of support mechanism that I could reach out to.  After several tries and a long wait I was contacted by someone who couldn't seem to use the app to connect or talk to me, their English seemed in question.  I disconnected and the person called.  I decided to give it a try.  I explained that I couldn't get into my email account and he said in two hours he would give me a reset link.  Well as all here know that never happened.  I got so mad I canceled my 365 subscription but now I can't reach out to any type of support.  As many here have said, they shouldn't provide or sell products if they can't support them.

Michelle,stressed & exhausted,"On one hand it feels ridiculous to say that life is a nightmare right now because I know there are worse things in life...on the other hand my stress level from dealing with Microsoft lately is so bad that I'm struggling to function. I am a small business owner who can't afford to slow down for a day much less days which run into weeks sometimes.  I've had many issues with Microsoft over the years but recently it has gotten much worse because of the length of time it takes just to get support on the phone. Just today I've been back and forth dealing with an issue for over 8 hours now. About 85% of the time was spent trying to be in contact with them.  I started the process by opening a ticket to get a call back.  After waiting a half hour I decided to go through the chat where I explained that I prefer to speak to someone over the phone but I wasn't receiving a call back.  They connected me to someone else by chat whom I ended up giving my phone number to then I got a call from him right away.  That guy gave me several things to do then I had to leave to go pick up my son so I could not stay on the phone.  I asked him if he could call me back in 10 min and he said yes but to select the link he would send to my email which would forward me back to chat where I would be able to ask for another call back right away. Naturally, the link did not work.  It brought me back to the chat but would not allow me to send a message so I had to start from scratch and open another ticket to chat again.  The next person I chatted with gave me a number to call but when I tried that number it tells me that support has moved online.  I had to open another ticket to chat again and that person could not find a way to get me in contact with anyone by phone so I ended up trying steps with him through the chat.  In the meantime I finally received a call back from ticket I had opened earlier.  That call was useless because it brought me to an automated system that put me on hold for at least 20 min. I continued the chat process while holding and before ending the chat the guy told me my issues were surely fixed and that he'd email me a link to fix one more thing but I had to wait to get email till chat ended. In addition, he told me he'd send a link to find out more about the business support section since I had so many issues and couldn't continue working.  He said the business help would be much faster.  I asked him if he was sure I could do that because I have windows home software and he told me""it is for sure"". We ended the chat and I waited for over a half hour and still hadn't received the email so I started another chat to ask them to send me an email with the links. I received the email from the next person right away.  After trying those links, neither one helped because the business link didn't get me to anything to learn more about it and the other link brought me to something to run which ended up not working.  This time I went back and opened another ticket to get a call back again...thankfully this time I didn't wait as long and it connected to someone when I received the call.  I have now been on the phone with them for 2 1/2 hrs Performing a  Windows 10 In-Place Upgrade because apparently one or some of the updates along the way completely screwed up my computer.  While on the phone with this person I inquired about the business support and told her what the guy said and she told me that information was wrong and that I could not use business support.  I asked her if there is a number to call in case this does not fix the problem because I can't keep submitting tickets and wait so long for someone to get back in touch with me.  This uses up way too much time that my actual work is not getting done. Over the 2 1/2 hrs so far she has given me 3 different numbers to try....these are different numbers than what I have already been given today...none of which worked because they all went straight to a sound that likely means disconnected. Oddly, she was stumped and couldn't understand why those numbers didn't work.  Apparently, Microsoft support representives have not been told that there is no way to contact them without submitting a support ticket and waiting forever for a response.  After the upgrade was done she said she'd send an email and if I continue to have issues I could reply to that email to get a quicker response from her since there was no number to call. I made sure to receive the email before we got off phone and in addition I made sure to reply and had her read my reply to make sure she recieved my email.  I know I sound like a crazy person, but Microsoft is making me crazy!I wish I was extreamly rich and could sue Microsoft for all the business time lost along with the stress it's caused that has likely taken years off of my life.  In addition, I wish I could afford to trash everything Microsoft in my house and purchse Mac.  Microsoft is killing me.",1,2021-10-21T02:48:21.000Z
Kicia Coldspring,Shi++y Customer Service.  Reneged on Paid Extended Warranty Agreement.,"For the past several months I have been trying to get an extended warranty exchange for my Acer computer purchased at a Microsoft physical store.  Unfortunately, there are no longer any physical stores and I will never purchase a PC from them again.   Because my product is a ""non-Microsoft"" product, they apparently outsource the extended warranty to a third party.  Despite calling and speaking to Microsoft support agents nearly 100 times, I was never able to get a phone number, email, or contact information for that warranty company.  I paid $150 for the additional insurance in addition to the cost of my computer and Microsoft refuses to honor it.  I was given incorrect numbers to call. I was hung up on by an agent, lied to by an agent, and I was refused the option to speak to a supervisor.  My warranty has now expired within the last week and my computer is still completely broken and unusable.  I am a stay-at-home-work-from-home mom and this has cost me dearly.  Fu(k Microsoft.  Never again.",1,2021-10-19T04:37:48.000Z
Nathaniel Knight,PATHETIC Microsoft Customer Support (NO REAL REPRESENTATIVES),"How can such a huge corporation such as Microsoft be such a fail when it comes to support? Amazon has great support. Apple has good support and stores. Lots of electronic companies have decent support.Yet, Microsoft, the same people who make Windows on nearly every PC in the world, associated with Bill Gates, one of the wealthiest people in the world, can't even have a straight-forward customer support system?!I bought an item from their ""Microsoft Store"" because of attractive prices with student discounts. Then, they ship it to me with a fraudulent shipping carrier, GLS. This carrier is known to steal Microsoft products. Guess what? My package goes missing and I can't even find a real damn representative to talk to at Microsoft. I call their number ""1-877-696--7786"", which just says ""We've switched all our support online, go to help.microsoft,com, good bye"" and the damn thing hangs up. I go online to ""chat with a representative"", who types awfully a lot like a robot (you sure this is a real person?), only to be given a phone number. I call that phone number, which just tells me to go online. There ends up this endless cycle where you scroll through 20 Microsoft webpages trying to find someone to contact.In short, WHAT A PAIN IN MY @SS!! Microsoft Support is nothing but a load of cr@p!! Their ""Customer Service"" is nothing but a bunch of random, untrained ""Ambassadors"" from all around the world who answer forum questions when they're bored enough and have the time.Do yourself a favor and NEVER order anything from the Microsoft Store. Go to Amazon, Best Buy, NewEgg, etc. The ""discounts"" they offer are not worth it. I would have gladly paid an extra $200 to avoid all this headache and to get a real damn carrier to deliver my packages, not GLS. Hell, I would have been okay with FedEx. Their support is a joke. No wonder there stores closed down while Apple stores are still open. Because they lack common sense. They're useless.",1,2021-10-19T04:06:40.000Z
Jon,Surface Laptop Studio is Garbage in a Box,"The Surface Laptop Studio delivers BROKEN. Out of the box, the operating system causes blue screens of death and total loss of data every ~2 minutes. When I tried to exchange the broken product for a fixed one, I was told to simply place a new order and receive a refund on the first order to get the replacement product in 2-3 days. I did this, and was then told (AFTER I paid ANOTHER $3000+) that my replacement wouldn't deliver for another four weeks--even though the broken one delivered in 2 days, and I was expressly told that the replacement would deliver in 2-3 days.When I called customer service, they told me that their warehouse is only full of broken, already-returned devices, and that they don't have any functioning devices to ship. Note that this product was only released less than 2 weeks ago, so I assume my experience is not unique. When I said that answer was unsatisfactory given what I had been told by the previous customer service representative, I was told that the person I was speaking with *didn't have a supervisor* and that *no one else* worked in the customer service department of the entire Microsoft Corporation.I've canceled both orders now to have my entire ~$7000 refunded. I will update this review if I'm given any more trouble on getting my money back. I won't be purchasing a Microsoft product ever again. While I've been a lifelong customer so far, resisting the allure of the (much cheaper) Apple products, I will now be making a total switch. I'm not giving up $3000 on products that come off the assembly line broken and ""2-3 day"" delivery periods that somehow translate to 4 weeks in reality. If you read this review, I implore you not to purchase the Surface Laptop Studio or any Microsoft product unless you want to endure a similarly miserable experience and 2 weeks of no laptop computer.",1,2021-10-18T18:05:10.000Z

I spent 8 hrs. plus, trying to get in touch with someone at microsoft who could help and going through documentation, much of it misleading and some of it absolutely inaccurate.  My problem could have been resolved in 20 minutes or less, if I had been able to talk to someone. I was finally able to activate W10 Pro by going online and copying a generic product key and using it.  When it says click here to talk to an agent, to me that means a person, to Microsoft it means a robot.

I've tried again about 100 times and I just can't cancel it. There's also no option to turn off recurring billing and it's impossible to get through to an agent for help.

Daniel,Support so bad it must be on purpose,"No idea how this company functions. Managed to order an Xbox series x. Everything works as it should: I'm charged, thing ships, tracking number. Then I get an update from UPS that the order is being held due to missing import documentation. I ordered from my country's MS store, paid local sales tax, and had no idea the thing would be imported. Ok fine, I call UPS. UPS says to get MS to send them the docs. Easy enough, except it's not. Hours with multiple MS customer service agents and nobody can help. Support tickets opened just to make me go away, and subsequently abandoned. Silly suggestions, like I should argue with UPS about the finer points of EU/CH cross border commerce laws and convince the brown khaki army that it is they who are mistaken and whatever sticker MS put on the box must suffice. Obviously doesn't work. Whatever. UPS sends box back to MS after a week of MS-support ignoring me. I call MS again to try to get them to resend. Support ticket, escalation, hours on phone. I'm told it's impossible for them to go to warehouse, put postage on box, and put it in the mail. Faster than light travel is arguably impossible. Violating energy conservation is likely impossible. Sending a box from one place to another is one of the fundamental tasks of an E-commerce shop.Fast forward to an hour ago. I get a mail MS just refunded the purchase. No other contact at any point the entire time. Of course the things are perpetually out of stock so can't reorder. They probably just have one they're shipping in circles. Mind numbingly terrible customer support. Lose-all-faith-in-humanity level customer support. If you find yourself at the gates of hell and the devil gives you a choice between a bed of hot coals, an eternity of Ellen reruns, or a quick call to MS support to help him fix his laptop, take the coals. -1 Stars.",1,2021-05-21T22:03:59.000Z
A. Customer,How much is enough?,"Where do I begin?  So many problems, so little time.* Purchased a laptop with Windows Home preinstalled.  I then purchased an ""upgrade"" to Windows Pro.  After approximately one year, I performed a reinstall of the OS (as I do periodically).  Upon completing the reinstall, Windows 10 reverted to the Home Edition (it inexplicably could not ""remember"" that this was upgraded to a Pro version).  I tried to ""re-upgrade"" to Pro, but the computer asked for a license key WHICH MICROSOFT DID NOT PROVIDE AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL UPGRADE.  Called support and selected support for a new purchase as I otherwise would not get a human (was referred to the useless support website).  Was informed that THEY REFUSED TO GIVE ME A LICENSE KEY FOR MY SOFTWARE EVEN THOUGH THEY CONFIRMED MY PURCHASE.  Support representative had me go through a number of ridiculous steps to re-upgrade to Pro.  If I need to do this again, I was told I will need to call them again.  Looks like I will be going through this approximately once per year.  Even though I OWN a Pro license, Microsoft has found yet another way to treat customers like they are doing us a favor using this exceptionally mediocre OS.  Even though they ASK FOR A LICENSE KEY to restore my purchase, THEY WON'T GIVE IT TO CUSTOMERS AT TIME OF PURCHASE ANY MORE unless you buy an OEM version.  This is idiotic.* Microsoft's computerized telephone support menu (1 (800) 642-7676) is ACTIVELY hostile toward customers.  The default response for almost all menu choices is to refer you to their useless websites and disconnect the call.* Customer service reps are generally not empowered to help customers.  They come across as apathetic and often behave in a childish manner (ex. they routinely transfer customers to random extensions or will abruptly disconnect when they know the call is not going well).  They routinely refuse transfer requests to a supervisor when politely requested and refuse to provide their employee id number/unique identifier when they are unprofessional.To be blunt:  Microsoft has never been a great company.  Its products historically have been unreliable and riddled with security and/or design flaws (the Windows OS being the prime example, the Surface Pro being a more recent example with all of its chronic overheating issues/malfunctions).  Its customer service is ""on par"" with the horrible quality of most of its products.It's sad that Microsoft has been able to use its 500 pound gorilla status to stifle or destroy better products that compete with Microsoft's flagship OS and other products (ex. OS/2 anyone?).Sadly, exceptionally poor customer service and product design driven by greed is the norm for corporate America.  Pathetic.",1,2021-06-24T18:59:03.000Z

Katelyn Anderson,WORST customer service experience of my life,"I ordered an XBOX controller from the Microsoft Store for my husband. 2 weeks after it was scheduled to be delivered, I received an email FROM MICROSOFT stating that my package was lost. The email said to click the button below to reach customer service for a refund or to request the item purchased be sent again. I clicked the button and it sent me to the generic microsoft customer service website. No phone number, no way to talk to a person, nothing.I finally clicked on the closest thing to my situation because there was literally no other way to request anything about this order. I figured the closest thing was a return so I requested a return and in the comment section I wrote ""did not receive item - please send another."" Well a couple days later I receive another email from Microsoft asking me to print out their little packing slip and go on and ship the controller back. OK. Can't do that because I never received the thing. I searched everywhere and I mean EVERYWHERE on their website and finally got to a place where I requested a call back from a representative. They called and then transferred me and transferred me and y'know an hour later I got an actual customer service person on the phone. She asked me at least 10 times if I was sure that the email that the package was lost came from Microsoft. YES YES YES I AM SURE I CAN FORWARD THE EMAIL TO YOU YES IT CAME FROM YOU. Then she asked me what my tracking number was to see if it was delivered. Fine whatever, don't believe me. I gave her the tracking number. Then she was like, so are you wanting to send the controller back? I kinda lost it at this point because HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO SHIP SOMETHING BACK THAT I NEVER RECEIVED?! OMG YOU SENT ME THE EMAIL!So anyway I asked to speak with the supervisor and they said they'd escalate my situation. They said that they couldn't process a refund because I had begun the ""return"" process which apparently cannot be cancelled by the consumer or by anyone in the customer service department.I'm honestly shocked at how terrible this experience was. I would expect better from Microsoft. I love my Apple devices and wish they made a gaming console so that I never had to deal with Microsoft again.",1,2021-08-27T01:28:12.000Z

Nicholas Tee,To be absolutely honest I really dislike having to provide a bad review for any company ... BUT there are exceptions.,"To be absolutely honest I really dislike having to provide a bad review for any company ... but what I dislike even more is when a company appears not to care whatsoever about their paying customers ... and can't be bothered to try and improve what they are doing wrong, and especially can't be bothered to admit they have a problem and apologize when required.I recently had a case where automatic updates of Win10 were 'forced' upon 2 of our business computers (one of which was a brand new Dell) and it caused 3+ weeks of absolute nightmare for us. I personally spent over 60 hours trying to manoeuvre my way through a ""Tech Support"" infrastructure that did anything and everything to deter and stop the customer from being able to talk to someone.When I finally managed to get a person on the line, I was then literally forced to keep changing who to speak to in 3 different countries ... and each time I had to start from scratch again. When a business customer has to spend over 60 hours on the phone to fix a Windows-caused problem, the least Microsoft could do is offer an apology, if not compensation. But we were offered NOTHING.What I did discover through this experience though is that if you are a customer in the US, then you get a somewhat better level of service, BUT if you are located anywhere else in the world (in my case New Zealand) we are left feeling like we are simply not good enough.The other significant issue I discovered during that 3 week downtime is that because we are a customer that has purchased several Microsoft solutions on CD-ROM (in our case MS Office, Publisher, Project Manager and others), Windows 10 updates are being constructed and delivered to push customers towards using Office 365. In fact part of the time I had to spend on the phone involved their Win10 specialists having to go into our systems and remove and disconnect parts of Win10 so that we could actually install the MS products that we had legitimately purchased. That is simply the worst and borders on the blatantly unethical.BUT what I must add in closing is that I don't believe the problem with Microsoft Support is necessarily the fault of the person actually on the phone trying to help, because I found most of them really wanted to help. The biggest problem is how the system is designed and operates ... and I suspect is the problem of a Management infrastructure where no attention is given to maintaining any type of Quality Assurance. In fact, if a senior member of the Microsoft Management (or Directors) had been sitting here with me over that 3 week period, they would have left disgusted with what their own company is doing, and to the extent of which their international Customer Support System is failing.Things became so bad that I was approached by a couple of Consumer organisations and asked to do interviews with the ... which I was only too happy to do. BUT did I receive any approach from Microsoft Management .... NO, not one single word .... from anyone that had any association with Microsoft.And so I leave the worst till last. I own a company that provides an online service to customers in different parts of the world ... and part that includes providing Customer and Tech Support. I learned a long time ago that Customer support can make or break a business ... and so with that knowledge and experience I run a business that commits to getting back to a customer in a maximum of 4 hours ... wherever in the world they are.So I have to ask ... if a baby company like ours can achieve that ...

I have not a clue where who and what would be signing on, and you know you never know if they remain. Then they want me to reset my password. WHY?? it works every day? In fact, I was signed into my Microsoft account.Then finally the rep disconnected from the chat after I waited 25 minutes for him to arrive. I have been a PC girl since the 1980s, but I hate all of the Microsoft products. I wanted to like them but today proved my point. Horrible customer service, if you can get them! Products that don't work as promised, still to this day, but they beg me every day to make them my default. My mistake, I should have known better. But I will remember today for a very very long time. Google is Superior!!!",1,2021-06-16T17:19:23.000Z

Nick Alton,Surface Book 2 destroyed by MS update,"My surface book 2 was in the process of carrying out a Microsoft update when the screen / PC went dead. Tried advice on MS web site, didn't work, took PC to local PC support and he said he had received 5 other PCs with exact same symptoms. Got in touch with MS support. they repeated the same key board sequences I had tried and still didn't work. In the end they said the PC is out of warranty (2 months) and it will cost £427 to have a reconditioned one. Even though it was caused by an automatic microsoft update (nothing I had done). No compensation no admission that they had caused it. Suggest you NEVER BUY a MICROSOFT PC. (I asked PC support which PCs he see's the least of and it's not microsoft PCs)",1,2021-06-16T07:13:30.000Z

If i knew it was this big of a hassle i wouldn’t have sent it but i know people who have sent their controller off and it came back within a suitable time even during the pandemic. It’s a very frustrating time as i thought it would be back in no time and then i can get on with playing but it is still out there.""",1,2021-06-15T19:46:27.000Z

Stuart Speirs,Terrible Returns Procedure,"Crack appeared on my Surface laptop screen, went to the website and uncovered a known flaw with the same issue. Delved further into the website for customer support and couldn't complete the process online, on-screen message warning telling me that 3rd party cookies were blocking the order process and to try other devices. Tried on various other devices and browsers even adding the website URL to my allowed cookies list but all with the same warning. Looked at customer chat but only operated during office hours Nicaragua - really bloody helpful to customers in the UK. Eventually went through a 2hr chat process with an agent in Nicaragua (that's how I knew) who organised a returns process. Had to copy and paste a verification code sent to me by email but the agent kept misspelling my email address adding to the overall time taken to resolve the issue.Big tech companies like Microsoft have absolutely no excuse not to have a call centre in the country where sales are made, had I been able to call someone in this country the process would have taken 10 minutes - so much for making the world more efficient, they can't see how penny pinching makes the world worse.",1,2021-06-12T01:01:11.000Z

Danny Frantjeskos,Why is Microsoft allowing people to price gouge all the Xboxes that are available?,I have been trying to buy an Xbox series X for months and every time they have a couple on any website they are either sold instantly or the website allows for them to price gouge. I don't understand why Microsoft doesn't have a waitlist or we can pay for it and they can send it to us as they get them instead of selling them to all these other sites so that way no one has the option of getting one. People are buying them all up and selling them for two or three times the amount they're worth and it's no fair to people who have supported Xbox since they started and have been patiently waiting to be able to get one. I really don't want to invest all my games and everything and do a PlayStation I've never liked PlayStation but I'm very tempted to get one cuz I'm sick of all this price gouging and scamming going on.

LOUISE TURP,What an absolute joke,"What an absolute joke. I have an email account that I am unable to access as they locked me out of it. This was over a year ago and I am still battling with them to regain access. Their reason for locking it is that they claim there was suspicious activity however I hadn't logged in from anywhere or visited any sites that I hadn't done so a thousand times before however from their perspective this particular day it was suspicious. I tried using the form to regain access but the mobile number on the account is no longer in use and because they have locked me out i can't get in to change it to get the verification text and when you select the alternative verification they provide the questions are just ridiculous, previous passwords on the account- if you knew the previous passwords then there wouldn't be any to list because they wouldn't have been changed, email addresses from the last 5 emails you sent and 3 of the exact subject lines, Skype name and 3 contacts- for those that don't know the skype name is not just your name its some stupid thing like for example live:.cid.e5618bdd42d67c59. Something you would need to get into the account to copy and paste but you can't even get into that because you are locked from the email account and so locked from the skype associated with the account, which also means you can't  access contacts either, I've spoken to people on there I no longer talk to so I don't know who is on it and can't find out because I can't get in.The other one is if you have purchased and microsoft products and if so the last 4 numbers of the card used. This is an ongoing battle ive been having for over a year. I couldn't remember those details back then so really how likely is it i will remember them over a year later.Every attempt I've made to communicate this with them and find alternative way of resolving this has fallen on deaf ears all I keep getting is the same email  with the same form they keep telling me they don't have enough information on and I keep telling them i don't have information on",1,2021-09-21T13:09:23.000Z

He admitted he hadn't done it before and I was passed from one to another for OVER EIGHT HOURS! None of them seemed to know what they were doing and all tried to blame our internet. We have fibre-optic broadband and a speed of 45+MBPS. I rang the next day to give them a chance to rectify what they had done and was told they ""don't troubleshoot"" and to contact Apple. I repeatedly pointed out that I am a lady in my seventies and was getting more and more stressed and distressed by the damage to my computer. They really didn't care and despite admitting that their agent should not have tried to force my computer to take a programme it couldn't take, washed their collective hands.  Luckily I kept screen shots and a recordings of all the relevant interactions! Apple were absolutely brilliant! One of their agents spent literally hours sorting it out, with humour and patience and total efficiency! (Brad, you're a star!)

Iuliia Kepley,Microsoft doesn't take responsibility for its manufacture's defect,"For the last 1.5 year I have been dealing with an issue with my laptop Surface Pro 4 – screen flickering. For the last couple months, I contacted the customer service department to solve my problem. After all possible troubleshooting steps I was informed that it’s a manufacture defect which is applied to majority Surface Pro 4 laptops. I was informed that my warranty was extended for 3 years and expired at the same time, so I’m not eligible for exchange and I have to pay $600 for a refurbished laptop. All Microsoft stores are closed, and my laptop cannot be fixed. I took my laptop to the different repair shops, and they denied accepting it because it is Microsoft manufacture defect.As a respectful Company I supposed you have to take responsibility to fix your manufacture defect. I do not understand how the warranty can expired on something that was wrong in the beginning.If this is a manufacture’s defect than why limit the claim period to 3 years? why not make a total recall and exchange it for us as your customer? Feel being cheated with this unethical business practice, since it was a faulty device, Microsoft should announce a total recall on this model and not trying to limit the claim time.As a leading international brand in IT world please be genuine in offering the claim on your own faulty or it may ruin market perception and confidence toward your branding.",1,2021-07-29T22:18:45.000Z
Avner Falk,Offensive “relationship manager”,"I have been a loyal Microsoft customer, beta tester, Windows Insider and Office Insider for many years. I have paid this company thousands of dollars and given it a great deal of invaluable feedback. When I bought my Microsoft 365 subscription it included an  Outlook account with the ability to send messages to up to 500 correspondents from a third-party e-mail client (Mozilla Thunderbird). There were many bugs in this feature which were slowly ironed out by the Outlook back-end team. During the past few months these bugs have returned. Now, instead of fixing them, Microsoft has sent me a very rude and offensive letter from a “relationship manager” named Ricardo Sérgio that is totally irresponsible and unprofessional, denying that there is any problem and closing the case. This is a very bad mistake on Microsoft’s part. You may wish to be very cautious in your dealings with Microsoft and make sure they do not break their contract with you in the way they have done with me.",1,2021-07-29T08:13:00.000Z

I don't know where they come up with their web app design, but it REALLY STINKS.  They try to make things too easy, but in doing so they over complicate. (You have to have a certain type of MS account ((work or school --What is that?)) to sign in you can buy these vouchers at 11.378% discount (but only Tuesdays during the full moon  -- J/K)   Fill in their overly long form and it bombs at the end because you didn't use the correct account.

Nash H,Microsoft Has Horrible Customer Service Reps,"Today I was notified that my hotmail account was compromised and hacked along with someone tried to log into my yahoo, facebook, and gmail accounts. I was successfully able to change the passwords to all accounts accept my hotmail account in which I have not used in over 5 years which of course means I have forgotten all answers to security questions and passwords. I reached out to customer service today via chat and was connected unfortunately with a chat representative by the name of Lois Evans. At first she was nice and professional but continued to repeat herself as to telling me the same thing over again of how to log in. I explained that I had tried the different options already but did not mind trying again for her. She proceeded to tell me that there was nothing else that she could do since the account WAS NOT COMPROMISED and that I was the only one to make changes to the account that there was nothing more that she could do. At this point...RED FLAGS went up because I'm like wait what CHANGES...because I have not made any changes and I have no way of accessing this account. I proceeded to tell her this and she she tells me that since there was nothing else that she could do then would I consider saying that she had addressed the issue and end the chat. I told her no because she did not help me and that I felt that she had no idea what she was doing. Lois Evans then states that ""This wouldn't have happened if I had set security questions."" At this point I'm infuriated. What customer service chat representative tells a customer this? She then sends that message for me to create a new account and this time create security questions. I asked for this issue to be escalated and she tells me that there is no way for this to be escalated and that there is no one in the microsoft company that can help me at this point. BULL CRAP!! If this is what customer service is like at MICROSOFT then they definitely do not need to be in business. To treat a customer who is a victim of potential identity theft in such a distasteful and ugly manner is unacceptable and should not be tolerated at all! I am highly upset and will no longer be a microsoft customer going forward.

Nevertheless, I raised my ticket, and needless to say, I cannot find access to it anywhere in the account anymore.

Pam,Worst Tech Support I’ve Encountered,"I lost my previous OS which was a genuine Microsoft Windows 10 Home with original eom by attempting to activate a purchased Windows 10 Pro activation key. The new windows pro key didn’t work and messed up my computer so i had to contact support. I lost internet connection, my gpu driver, dual screen mode and etc. My original product key didn’t work anymore so I had to contact Microsoft Support and they were not very friendly. The technician was very rude and indirectly told me to shut up when I was telling him about what happened with my OS. He cut me off and told me to just “help him” with the info he needs which was my product key. He gave me a bunch of keys and it did not work. Eventually he just left me hanging and ended the call without resolving the issue. It was a very bad experience and I ended up paying twice for my OS. I had to pay an extra 200 for windows pro after this incident. Such waste of time and money.",1,2021-04-03T07:19:07.000Z

Ttom,"Pathetic support, agents behave arrogantly","I bought skype credit on Friday. However, today (Monday) my PC app says I have zero credit. So I 'chat' with microsoft. The microsoft agent abruptly disconnected the first chat, which lasted about 25 minutes, saying there was a problem with the connection. I was waiting forever for responses. In reality there was no connection problem.Below is some text from my second 'chat', which microsoft also abruptly ended.Msoft: Can you tell me what the issue with your Skype account is ?Me:	I bought 10 euros credit on Friday. When I logon to my skype PC app it shows 0 credit.(After waiting about 15 minutes I get this message from Microsoft.)Msoft: It seems that there is a connection issue. May I ask if you are still connected?Me:	Yes. The only connection issue is your slow responses.Msoft: Are you there?Me:	yes(After answering 'yes' I' get the following response from microsoft about 5 minutes later.)Msoft: I will need to put an end to this chat now due to your unavailability on this chat, Please feel free to reach out to us again using your case number 1019172761.

Alpesh,Ridiculous support service for business account - shame on you,There should be a way of giving negative stars. I have contacted office365 support 4 times. My last call lasted more than 1hr10min on hold. They then had the audacity to hang up. I had raised a ticket more than 2 weeks ago. They cannot still not put me in contact with someone technical to resolve something as simple as password reset which has been disabled on my business account. Every time I call they take my details and verification questions and promise someone will call. Hope you take notice of these disturbing reviews and pull up your socks Microsoft,1,2021-03-11T20:47:45.000Z

This morning at 1030 our email stopped sending on all accounts. After a few basic checks, I logged a call and stressed the severity of the incident...3 hours and 3 chase calls later I get a call asking to share my desktop. I tried to explain this was a server issue but the tech either did understand or know what I meant. 8 calls to the helpdesk later (you can't call a technician directly), the problem still has not been resolved...its 8.30 pm. As others have mentioned, the support are customer service trained but not technically trained.Once this issue is resolved I will be switching to another provider with a help desk that uses experienced technicians...",1,2021-03-10T20:51:36.000Z
Lee Wilbraham,Can't I give it half,"Can't I give it half! Totally non-existent customer support.  I have been locked out of my emails and Microsoft account. I do not have access to Skype, outlook or MS Word (I pay for this) OneDrive etc. I've gone through the convoluted verification process 5 times, provided all my info, everything and Microsoft still denys me access to MY mail, like an evil postman. I have other accounts, connected to my email, that I desperately need access, to prevent payments leaving my bank account. Micosoft insist in sending my verification code to an old and deleted work email. It's not been used in 2 years and I don't have access. I've tried to be connected to a human but I get asked to log in to do this (I cant, Microsoft sends confirmation to the locked account) This is totally illegal. If a customer is unable to solve this problem online, Microsoft MUST provide human customer support. Awful, amateurish system.",1,2021-03-08T15:30:55.000Z

I asked if I could disable bing and he wanted to know the age of my 4 yr old laptop, I said you're not helping me at all and hung up.",1,2021-03-06T21:32:41.000Z

Sean,Awful customer service from Microsoft,"Without doubt, single handed you the worst customer service experience ever with Microsoft.XBox ( which I sold 6 months previous and hardly used ) account hacked and over £200 taken from me.Reported it to them and was told yes you have been hacked , passed it onto security team and should be resolved in 7-10 days. Great I thought, good service and nice people.Fast forward 8 weeks to today....Spent several hours and phone calls with them - and have the usual nice call agent but can do nothing to help you except say ‘ I understand and apologise’, but ultimately end up saying someone will be in touch.Of course no calls or emails ever materialised.Then today the icing on the cake happened.Spent 90 mins ( was cut off twice, which I now know is a common thing with Microsoft) and got onto an agent.Told him it’s been 8 weeks since I was hacked and nothing has happened.No phone calls or emails etc etcSo he goes away as usual and come back after 7-8 mins and then explains to me a lot of stuff I already know.Then proceeds to tell me that there’s nothing more they can do because they cannot verify who I am. He suggests I open a mew account and forget the old one as quite ‘ there’s nothing else that can be done’.I asked him to repeat and he said the same thing.I was shocked and asked how else can I verify it’s me if you’re automated system  doesn’t recognise me?Again he said there’s nothing else he can do, even if he passed to his supervisor there’s nothing they would do and they wouldn’t even call me.At this point I put the phone down before I said something I might be arrested for.So I am supposed to write off the £200 that someone has taken from me. When I’ve been told that I was hacked when I alerted them 8 weeks ago.Microsoft couldn’t care less about it’s ‘ customers’, just take your money and then fob you off when there’s an issue.",1,2021-03-05T14:08:34.000Z
Invino Veritas,SLOW and unskilled support,"Office 365 support is very slow and it can take days to get answers. If you need immediate answers, you cannot get them. All support is contracted out to Nigeria or other places where the English is sketchy, but worse, the first level techs are basically useless. This is for an enterprise level product. What a shame.

Pearl M,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE --  NEGATIVE…,"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE --  NEGATIVE ZERO STARS.  Everything everyone else has said already.

Indira Gutierrez,Speechless,"Been on online chat since 2pm, it is now 8:30. I've been reconnected to like 10 different agents and the last one hung up on me while we were waiting for the trouble shooting he suggested to be done. I'm not sure if my screen glitching issue is fixed, but hopefully it is because this last guy that hung up on me had me reset my computer. I know that it's tough working in customer service, and I'm always respectful to those who are trying to help- but it almost seems like these agents don't know anything about computers and are just hoping the next agent will know. One of the agents suggested that the issue may be because I'm running too many applications at once.... I had word, excel and chrome open so I could look at data and work on homework. did she mean I had too many tabs on chrome open? I had about 6 open... but even then, this computer was sold to me under the guise that it could handle PhD level software usage. I didn't realize having multiple tabs open, using word, and excel would cause such huge issues on a surface book. So much time wasted.",1,2021-03-03T01:53:49.000Z

Dave,So bad it really hurts,"Do you have an issue, you can’t solve? Their “technical experts” can’t do that as well.The only solution they are capable to offer, are rudimentary fixes, you can simply google and do yourself in manner of minutes. Anything more complicated is beyond their capabilities, plus they aren’t willing to listen what the problem actually is, and that the “fix” they are trying to apply isn’t going to work because you already tried it.They basically act like they know better, while you sit and do your best to wrap your head around the fact how such a person is allowed to represent the Microsoft, with their limited knowledge and capabilities.And let’s not forget the common practice of terminating the chat without warning, when they find out the problem is beyond their capabilities, or telling you to restart your pc, and that they will reconnect with you after you do it. Spoiler alert...it won’t. You will be connected with a completely new person, and repeat the cycle of pointless rudimentary fixes all over again.They aren’t experts. They are plain amateurs.Seriously 0 wouldn’t be low enough.",1,2021-03-02T09:55:15.000Z

The support people are not in a position to help in any way and I was on hold for a really long time as they blundered their way through attempting to help me (the charger for a new Surface laptop did not work). The phone staff seem to have been trained in trying to be apologetic and empathetic, instead of in a position to solve problems quickly. If you want to buy a Microsoft product, do so at a store rather than online so then you can actually go and talk to real people who can do something about it when things go wrong.",1,2021-03-02T03:42:10.000Z

Got this laptop for Uni, still have to use it until June, and because of COVID and all my deadlines I can't get it fixed so I'm stuck with it.I take great care of my laptop and only ever use it for Uni work and to apply for jobs. 2 things that should not be causing it this much problem.

Despite providing the required information about my Skype account in order to prove that I am the legitimate subscriber, I got an automated message that I could not provide sufficient information. After talking to someone on the help line, who was nice and tried to assist, he said that he would pass it on. Since then I have not heard anything neither from this person, nor from anyone at Microsoft. I contacted BBB, who forwarded the complaint to Microsoft with no response. Taking the money without delivering the product is called theft, where I come from.",1,2021-01-24T18:50:00.000Z

The issue I have is before the call ended she referred me to the help section where she told me to click on 5 stars then told me to write 'problem resolved'. At first I didn't realise what was going on I was just following her instruction, I thought I was closing her communication adding a comment for her benefit.

We bought it there a couple months before we moved to Canada. It stopped working and just goes black screen. I have done everything online to fix it. It was broken within 3 months. They said they will not help with warranty as I bought it in Australia. How are we not notified of that? So now I have a $600 plus paper weight that's useless. They said all they can do is a new one for $350 with only 2 months warranty. What a rip!! It should be covered by warranty. Clearly they do this so they don't have to honor warranties. I am disabled and very low budget. I use a walker so gaming is one of the very few things I can do. I told them and they don't care for their customers. They are not worth it.

Sadly, you are on your own with laptop support in 2020.  I was actually hung up on by most of the so-called tech support advisors.In 2020, you have to learn how to be your own tech support, learn to live with your device as is, throw your device away, buy another & start the madness all over again, or pay more than your device is worth for paid support that will ultimately will not fix your problem.I paid $600 for a brand new laptop which was nothing but trouble.  Could never receive help, everyone wanted  money just to talk to me.  And that was while the laptop was still under warranty!  Once the warranty expired, no one would even talk to me.  All they wanted to do was sell me another useless warranty, which I refused to buy.Less than 1 year later, my laptop died for no reason.  Microsoft support killed it on purpose because I wouldn't purchase an extended warranty.  Windows 10 wouldn't start.  Tech support supposedly performed a factory reset and then Windows could not be reinstalled.  It froze at 3%, and that is the last I heard from them.  It has been over a week now.I have tried everything I can think of over & over & over.Nothing worked.   I have thrown my $600 dream laptop into the trash & have hopefully learned my lesson!I sure do miss the days when you could buy a laptop for a reasonable price and expect it to easily last 7 years or more.

Brent Poirier,Previously: Worst customer service of my life: Updated: Some of the best tech support of my life,"I am a lawyer. I'm adding new software to my Outlook 365. I discovered that in order to do so, I needed a business version of the Microsoft suite instead of the Home version. So I called Office 365 to discuss a business version. After a hold I got the person and explained that I want to switch from Home to Business 365. I also pointed out that Onedrive is an important component of this, and somehow I have two Onedrives using the same email address, on two different computers, and the two Onedrives don't talk to one another.The person said ""You have to talk with the Home Version Office tech support for the Home Version of 365 you presently have.""So after more transfers and more waiting the next person answered and we discussed the problem with Onedrive. So Office tech support for the Home version said I needed to talk to Onedrive tech support, and transferred me to Onedrive tech support.So after being on hold I then explained about the software and the Outlook and the 365 and the Home Version and the Business Version and the Onedrive. And I gave the fellow control of my laptop and he did his best to locate Onedrive and uninstall it from my Laptop, and then he would reinstall it and then it would link properly with the Onedrive on my PC. However, after  a long time he was unable to uninstall Onedrive and he said that I had a Windows problem so he handed me over to Windows tech support.  And Windows tech support clearly did not want to talk to me and said the previous guy had not done a proper handover and left no documentation so she had no idea how to help me and referred me back to Onedrive.Then she said, ""Unfortunately sir, I am not Windows tech support. I am Windows customer service. And in looking here it seems that you have an Office account. So I am going to transfer you to Office tech support."" And I explained that that is where I started and that everyone has passed me to the next person. Now she started getting nasty. I said, ""Please transfer me to your supervisor."" ""Certainly, sir. No problem. Which supervisor do you want? We have a tech support supervisor and a customer service supervisor and an Office supervisor.  Which one do you want?"" I said that was not fair because I don't know their hierarchy and I don't know which is appropriate. I then asked for her name and ID number. ""My name is Angel. I am not allowed to give any other information."" She kept asking which supervisor I wanted.""Tech Support"" I finally said. She pushed a button (I'm sure, triumphantly). A voice said ""Technical Support is now closed. Please call during our business hours."" So this left me with no functioning Onedrive and a loathing for Microsoft tech support.Update: I have now had one of the finest tech support experiences, from a capable tech, and my view of Microsoft has substantially changed. The whole business of having a personal onedrive from a Home 365 account and a business onedrive from a Business 365 account is a mess, and Microsoft should do a much better job of helping people to sort it out because it surely is a common problem. I was completely mystified until this later tech pointed out that when I have logged in via a web browser to my personal onedrive ""Live"" is part of the URL and that's how I can tell which one I am logged into. He also helped me to set up my file structure so that on the left I can see both Onedrives and can gradually move stuff between them. It has taken a fair amount of tech support to help me to set up my Outlook and calendar and whatnot, but having a capable tech support person makes the process day instead of night. My overall impression is that too many people from ... let's just say other countries outside of the USAA where tech support may be sited ...  who work tech support or take these calls are too eager to pass problem cases to others. So I will revise this review from a 1 star to a 3 star. Because my prior experiences were 1's and my current ones are 5's.",3,2021-03-10T03:26:18.000Z

JENNIFER OHENE,Microsoft 365 Family - Microsoft not helpful when you have a problem,"I subscribed to Microsoft 365 Family last year.  I was able to install it but whenever I go to open it, it came up with an error message.  I uninstalled, then installed several times - no change.  I rang Microsoft.  After ""taking me round the houses"" with the call, I managed to speak to someone who took control of the computer and sorted it out.  3 days later, same problem again.  I got frustrated and stopped using the programme that I have paid for.  Every so often, I will try again.  Same problem.  Tried to see if I can call Microsoft.  There is no number to call them in the UK for Microsoft 365 Family issues.  There is a virtual assistant which is no good.  It gives you the option to have a call back.  I put my phone number in but it said it couldn't get through.  This week, I decided to resurrect the programs.  Its the same problem again.  Error codes and then it also came up that my subscription was due for renewal so I should renew but my subscription is not due for renewal until November 2021.  Very frustrated.  I have 2 subscriptions with Microsoft. The other one is a business subscription and when I had similar problem, I was able to talk to someone and had the issue resolved.  This is a joke.

Marianne Heijneman,Microsoft: Nr 1 in client unfriendliness!,"I have never encountered a more client unfriendly company as Microsoft. Last December I had to take a Business package to be able to deliver training with Teams. I was told that the cost of my personal 365 package will be refunded within a month (at least that is what I understood). So after a month I contacted Microsoft to ask for my refund and they said I should have stopped the personal 365 package myself and since I did not do that within 30 days, it is not possible to cancel and no refund will be made. Both departments (business & personal) told me to contact the other department and said there was nothing they can do. So this year I pay double for using Microsoft software. And even worse was the negative and unfriendly attitude of the call centre people. Although I can imagine that explaining the client unfriendly policies must give them negative conversations all day. Another thing is that I perceive working with the Microsoft website as extremely complex, maybe because I am used to the simple & consumer friendly approach of Apple.

G Host,Microsoft’s support is abysmal.,"Microsoft’s support is abysmal.Their admin center causes pains in my heart it is so bad.but let us focus on their support.I have had the dissatisfaction of having to deal with them a lot over the years.When you call, you are guaranteed to reach someone who has less technical knowledge then you do, who live of a knowledge base.Microsoft would probably benefit more by firing them all and just using an AI to hand to KB articles instead.Normally I would disagree with that statement but since the agents very rarely read and understand your ticket properly anyway, the human element is lost.I cannot find the right word which is not insulting to accurately describe just how bad their support is, so I am just going to say poor, and you can substitute poor for the worst possible word you can think of.I have had to deal with this “Poor” support for about 5+ years. You are almost certain to end up with a person from a country in Africa or Asia.Pointing this out not by indication of racism, I have nothing against humans from these regions of the world, but I do have a huge issue with people who are hired to do a job in a language they can hardly speak / understand, whom I find very difficult to eligibly understand.and there is trickery involved, some of these technical representatives sound and seem like they can communicate proficiently, but then you left with their actions which leave you questioning their ability to read, listen and understand.I too have been lied to, several times in fact. I have been told to delete our tenant account, thankfully that had a 30 day, “are you really sure” period where on another call for a separate matter the agent pointed out how horribly wrong the action of their colleague was and reversed that action.I have been told a malicious email is legitimate, and then a different agent changed their mind.there is no internal cross department communication, they don’t call, email, or even look at the same ticket.If you have a problem that god forbid, includes, or is linked to a few different tools such as OneDrive and Exchange, good luck, each time your handed over to the next department you get a new ticket.you have to start from scratch again.If you are not clear what kind of business you are but arrive at the right department, bad luck to you, unfortunately this case was relating to an educational institute, I got to the onedrive department and they said they could not help because I was calling from an educational institute and that I needed to go to the OneDrive for Education department if such a place even exists.and to stack on top of that, If your using their IOS apps, your screwed. These are not people who can use IOS.trying to fix an issue with their own app on IOS, not going to happen.So you end up at a brick wall with around 10 different ticket numbers and a slap in the face “we can fix it”, followed by a wave of spam like calls from some African claiming to be a supervisor asking for feedback on an array of closed cases that have already had feedback digitally provided, which they basically force you to do at the end of the call.not to mention, they have no concept for time zones, so even if you put in GMT+1 and specifically state in the case notes call me during working hours.you can bet your getting a call between 8PM and 4AM.@Gunter, I am sure Conor Davies has communicated my frustrations over the admin center to you.if you would like some help improving the UI and making this better, so that I would not have to call support so often.It would be my pleasure to assist.RegardsDaniel Kritikos",1,2020-12-17T08:48:37.000Z
Kristy Lorenzen,They LIED,"They LIED. Told me a refund request was denied because I had asked for too many refunds this year. I have asked for ZERO refunds (which was later verified by a rep on the phone finally yet they claimed they could not do anything for me and only gave me another electronic request to fill out). They were flustered when I asked why would that happen when that was not true? My account was hacked and $200 “Robucks” spent. No one in my household even plays that game. I changed password, added a pass key immediately. I was freaking out. Single mom here. Just before Christmas. Need to buy groceries. The fact that the refund was denied based on such a lie is so untrustworthy and causes absolute lack of respect and trust now in their entire system.  Then, when trying to fill out a request or feedback, their customer service form limits your text characters to a very small amount. Can’t get a hold of a real person. Shady. Awful. Bad business. Total lack of customer service. Their customer service motto is-We.Don’t.Care.",1,2020-12-16T04:07:08.000Z

And then when you do get them to call you, it’s someone in some other country that you can barely understand and that can barely understand you. The WORST part of it all is that they have absolutely no knowledge of anything. It just sounds like they’re reading FAQs from some random website. I CANNOT STAND THE LACK OF INCOMPETENCE AND IGNORANCE from Microsoft’s customer support. BY FAR, and I mean BY FAR, THE WORST customer support there is. Microsoft and Apple used to have the 2 best customer support. Now Microsoft has COMPLETELY gone to the other end of the spectrum. Now it’s just Apple that has the best customer support, which a shame because I have more Microsoft products than Apple products.

James Demaio,Support center= Urban Legend,"My friends my story begins on a sunny Monday afternoon. I had just returned from Colorado from my cousins wedding who ironically use to work for this company. I received an email from AOL saying my email had been logged into in Berkshire England. I began to scramble and immediately change my password but before I could I received a text from an automated number saying my email had been deleted from my Microsoft account, I started to sweat. Before I could even enter my number into the account recovery I receive another text saying my phone number has now been deleted off the account. Their support is entirely online and requires one of the two to file a support claim and their support number just sends you back to the website. I decide to call the sales department and choose the option where you inquire about purchasing a new Microsoft product. Sure enough this connects you to a live person who then has the ability to transfer you to a support center. I know I know I'm a genius. I try not to get to excited because I know its a long road ahead judging by their already magical fairy tale support center that can only be reached by calling the department that wants to take your money. As I begin my conversation with my support agent I can already tell this is going to be even harder than contacting this magical support center with live agents that its own website would you lead you to believe doesn't exist. I finally know what Pixar should make its next movie about. A young person who calls a Microsoft support number and actually reaches a live agent. What a fairy tale that would be. You would think that at these support centers if you reach one they would be staffed by Cinderella, the wizard of oz, or even Peter pan. As I began to speak to Cinderella I could tell she was immediately reading from a script and at best was writing a support ticket for someone to eventually call me back and attempt with their 1 hour course knowledge that Microsoft gave them to get the job. I ask to be transferred to the super visor. I am now speaking with Peter pan. Peter pan begins to explain that they had flagged the activity on my account as possible fraud. It is to my amazement that I realize this is just a cosmetic label because the hacker was still aloud to delete both the recovery email and phone number. Peter pan also begins to explain how they may go forward. He says they froze the account but they can't give me back by my account. Again I stand amazed. He than says that they will transfer my case over to their escalation team who will contact me within 5 days at the ""latest"". Flash forward to earlier today. It has been over 4 weeks and no call no text no email from these magical people. Did they exist? Did I ever talk to them? Were they even real? These are the questions I was asking myself before I called back today hoping to once again speak to the magical support people who's website claims they don't exist. I call the support center and it sends me into the old website loop. This time I didn't spend an hour exhausting every tedious number option only to be redirected to the support website. I call the sales department and explain my story and they agree to transfer me to the magical support center. The little mermaid answers after 40 minutes and transfers me to mufasa who then after 30 minutes on hold disconnects my call. I call the direct number the little mermaid gave me which what do you know leads me back to the automated system that directs me to the support website. I stand in disbelief. I call back and use my knowledge to get back to the magical support center through the sales department. After another transfer to a few more characters I am once again disconnected. Microsoft i promise if you give me my account back and an Xbox series X with a copy of cyber punk I will not post this review on reddit.",1,2020-12-04T10:51:59.000Z

I only received confirmation from 1 order now my account is being charged $4910.73.  I am beyond pissed. I will have to wait to receive the orders to return them so that I can get my money back.  I was transferred 5 times between Microsoft and Dell.  The Customer Service Team is clueless on what they are doing. This was my first time dealing with Microsoft and will be my last time.  I am planning to return all the orders back and not bother to keep the true order that I put in.  Poor service from such a huge corporation.  Lost my business,1,2020-12-03T20:58:23.000Z

Jill Holland,Microsoft customer service is not fit for purpose,"Microsoft customer service is non-existant. If you choose to spend a substantial amount of money on a Microsoft device then you’d better hope and pray that it  works and that you have no issues.  Should you have an issue then you will enter customer service hell. You cannot take the time and effort to go to a Microsoft store because they have permanently closed them all. Should your device need replacing (after you’ve spent days and days trying to speak to someone or disappeared down an online chat hole for hours) then you need to return it to them by courier. Only then will they send you a replacement and at the moment I am being told this might be a refurbished item!  Added to which, if you want them to send your replacement out by a faster courier service then you will have to pay for it!  And all this for an item that is literally weeks old.  What  am I supposed to work with during the time that takes?  I wonder why nobody at Microsoft seems to read or to care about the very negative feedback they get?",1,2020-12-02T15:02:51.000Z

Andy Kordalski,Nonexistent Support,"I've spent two weeks and a whole bunch of hours trying to get my warranty claim addressed, and I've been given nothing but empty promises and hollow expressions of sympathy. Microsoft's inability or unwillingness to provide support has absolutely obliterated my view of their brand.I bought a Surface Pro bundle at a warehouse store, and within 2 months, I experienced two failures. First, my Surface Pen stopped working. After 2 hours (!) chatting with their service team, they finally decided to ship me a new one, but only after I sent back (and they received) the non-working one. That was September 26th, it's now October 15th and I haven't even received tracking for the replacement yet (and yes, the unit I returned has been delivered).Less than a week after the Surface Pen quit working, the whole device stopped booting up. I believe it was a faulty Windows security update that did it. However, contacting support has been an absolute disaster. I have now attempted over two dozen times in 10 days to reach someone - ANYONE - who can help me resolve this issue, and I've gotten nowhere. The Surface Support team was completely unresponsive at first, providing nothing but an automated message stating they're not open despite my calling exclusively during the hours they state they're offering service. When I finally did get through, I was told multiple times that an exchange would be arranged, but there was never any follow up. They took my credit card info to process an ""advanced exchange,"" then sat on it and did nothing. I have made it clear to MS Support that this is my primary work computer, and I have now been completely unable to use it for 8 days and counting, so it's particularly infuriating that they aren't even TRYING to ship the exchange they've now promised to ship three times.I've had several other conversations with Microsoft's support teams at various levels through the organization, and no help has been offered. I've probably spent 8-10 hours talking to or waiting in line for support, and I've had no success.Since Microsoft's been so awful, I also tried filing a formal complaint through the Better Business Bureau. So far, that's proved fruitless as well, with Microsoft's ""response"" being to contact the same support teams that have failed so miserably already. And it took 3 days for them to even bother to provide THAT response. I will continue to pursue action through the BBB, but I'm not holding my breath that they'll have any leverage.Because of Microsoft's evident disregard for their customers, I will be returning my device to the store and replacing it with a product from a more responsive company. However, I have to wait for the stupid Surface Pen exchange to arrive in order to do that - and again, that's taken 3 weeks and STILL hasn't been resolved. So I'm stuck here with a non-working flagship device that's tying up money that could otherwise be used to buy a computer from a company that actually cares about its customers.",1,2020-10-15T17:40:57.000Z

I spoke to a supervisor and he promised daily updates from the escalations team. Since then, I have reached out 1-2 times daily and have gotten no response since. So basically, I have been scammed over $1100 and the support teams refuse to give me my money back, and now are refusing to communicate.

Ann Kennedy,Dead screen; no service,"Purchased a Surface Pro in Feb of 2018 and it died in late Sept of 2020. Screen went black while operating as usual. Since then, the screen has never functioned. I use it once per week, and it hasn't left my home, so issue is not from heavy use / abuse.Customer service can only be described as abysmal. Schedule calls with reps only to have them miss the appointment times, calling me back unpredictably 3 or 4 hours later instead of 90 minutes as shown on the website (by which time I'm in another appointment). Obviously, customers cannot be expected to remain available all day. Why show approximate call-back times when they are so misleading?Online chat shows the hours of operation, and yet it's closed across the board during those hours. Direct contradiction fuels mistrust and lack of confidence in the company.Talked to a local computer repair shop to learn that Surface Pros are cheaply and poorly made, so these issues are very commonplace and hard to fix. Likely, the computer is totaled. Recommend Microsoft learn from any one of the manufacturers with pride in what they do. I think it isn't impossible for Microsoft to outdo competitors by offering service that leverages hardware and operating system synergy, but now that seems like a distant and unlikely future.",1,2020-10-04T19:13:22.000Z

They said it would take 72 hours to complete but it has now been 2 WEEKS and everytime I call they have been useless in many ways including forwarding my call in mid sentence. They don't care.

Charlotte,Abhorrent experience- rude and unfriendly especially during these Covid19 times!!!!,"Awful, just awful support and customer service experience.Long story short I’m locked out of my email. The number associated with the account is an old number and I can’t try other passwords as it’s locked me out. I changed phone so wasn’t sure which password it was but I eventually was locked out. I tried the recovery form twice online and it said unfortunately I was unsuccessful. So since then I’ve contacted Microsoft via phone and Twitter and both have been absolutely useless and unable to help me access my account which I need for business and just general use. You would have thought, like most companies, during these times of covid19 that customer support would be much more helpful and supportive in helping you resolve issues but not Microsoft!For business I usually use windows 10 but I won’t be from now on- off to apple.Please please do not use this company- they genuinely have no compassion for those in desperate need and on the phone we’re very rude. Thank goodness I opted in for the telephone conversation to be recorded I’m hoping management listen to the call and realise how rude the employee actually was!I await, albeit with bated breath, for some sort of response actually wanting to help me.",1,2020-11-09T01:01:04.000Z

But they seem keen to remind of their office subscriptions (to 365) + after we kept ignoring that they wouldn't recognise free outlook email.  We forgot that password because couldn't check it. John Lewis no help tonight either when we texted problem with password.  So on control panel I removed office 365 + am glad that I have a macbook. Last Microsoft laptop were me down after 3 years. Wasn't always quick + windows 10 not best system. So I calculated how long a macbook would run without problems from a relative. She said 8 years, no problems. Also pages word processing free not on subscription + numerous apple extras, so I'm actually saving money already + even more if you say time is money. Apple updates so quick,  instructions so easy to follow on updates. I'd never ever buy Microsoft again.

Janet Wilson,Unable to access Windows 10,"I contacted Microsoft support for assistance after receiving numerous alerts on my computer.  After following the Microsoft technicians advice, word for word, my computer crashed.  I contacted Microsoft again as I now had an inaccessible computer with all of my work dating back stored on there.  This was the beginning of what was to be a four day (and night) ordeal.  Being determined to sort out the problem and recover my computer/work I spent in total four days, with very little sleep, not stopping to eat and missed time from work trying to sort the problem out through Microsoft Support.   Over the last few days I have spoken to various technicians who have all contradicted, or given conflicting advice but have all made changes to my computer which have now rendered it unusable.The final conclusion today after the Microsoft tech decided he couldn't fix the problem is 'take it to a local computer engineer to fix'.  You broke it Microsoft, therefore you should fix it!This is the worst customer experience I have ever had, I will never buy Microsoft products again and neither will I recommend them.  There is simply no point in spending money with the company as the risk of damaged goods and no resolution is too high.I will have to go and pay an independent to fix my computer, if that is even possible but in the meantime I have wasted four days on a service that appears amateur, to non existent.",1,2020-11-02T16:28:40.000Z

I also purchased Word 2019 upgrade and since then nothing but problems. The upgrade ruined several fonts, even Times New Roman. This is something though reported Microsoft has ignored. The latest error in my two Microsoft programs is that they now do not recognize the activation of my license. Today I was told there is no technical fix for this issue and I need to delete Word 2019 and usee only Word 2016. No, they won't issue a refund.

With the desktop I spend 5 hours on the phone with Microsoft going back a version and reinstalling the version and making sure all computers on the network had the same version of Windows 10.  Still neither is working correctly.  Last person I spoke with finally told me she was hanging up and would hove a supervisor call me tomorrow, we will see if that happens.

Oliver J,WORST.EXPERIENCE.EVER!,"I bought a Microsoft Surface laptop for law school. I confirmed with customer support that the laptop would arrive no later that Friday, August 14. This was important as my first classes were scheduled for Monday, August 17. The laptop came two days late (on Sunday, August 16) and was TERRIBLY damaged upon opening. After spending three hours on the phone with customer service - the entirety of which I spent asking for an expedited shipping label so that I could return and receive a new laptop as soon as possible -  I was eventually hung up on by the 16th or 17th person. Additionally, although I was assured I would receive a call during regular business hours the following day, I have yet receive a call three full days later (shocker). The end result is that I will not have a laptop for the first two to three weeks of school and I somehow am not eligible for any sort of refunds or credits back to my account (other companies regularly reimburse customers for poor service, but apparently Microsoft doesn't have enough billions to offer even partial reimbursements).After ten years of purchasing products online, I have never felt the need to write a negative review. However, the service I received from Microsoft was so poor - both in terms of the quality of the product received and the ""support"" that customer service provided - that I felt compelled to write this review.

Anthony,Useless money grabbing t***ers,"I bought an Xbox one in late March 2020 and had a ‘free month of Xbox game pass’. Not aware of what this was or the small print, I naively entered the code. Unaware I had to manually turn off recurrent billing I incurred 3 months of £7.99 payments for something I was not aware of or had never used. When I contacted Microsoft support their service was nothing short of abysmal. I had to speak to 7 people before finally getting through to a manager, 2 of which hung up on me, 1 promised to call back and never did. They said their hands were tied because ‘the policy does not allow them to refund products purchased over 28 days ago’. All customer service representatives were polite but utterly useless. Just like Amazon and other big companies Microsoft’s policies are completely designed to con hard working people of their money. I have withdrawn all transactions to Microsoft Xbox and will not be purchasing ANY of their products in future. They have lost a customer as a result. In short, I would recommend not buying from Xbox. If you do, be very wary of any small print/micro- transactions and action any mis payments quickly.",1,2020-08-18T11:13:54.000Z

I started with HP because I thought it was a printer problem. They sent me to Microsoft but the tech didn't take my phone number or open a case, so I couldn't get back to him after it disconnected. Apparently its a conflict between a Windows update and Word. The Microsoft folks have not helped at all. They keep disconnecting and then I have to start over, even with a case number (1009963844 for you Microsoft bleeps).

Rich S,So Disappointed with Microsoft Customer Service,"Let me start by saying I love or loved my Surface Pro 5. I’m so disappointed with Microsoft’s customer surface. 6 phone calls, disconnected twice and speaking to people in Central America and the Philippines with poor connections and poor English.My first call I was told the issue was my keyboard which i knew wasn’t true since my tablet also wasn’t responding. I was sent a new keyboard which also didn’t work. 2nd call disconnected after on hold for 30 minutes. 3rd call the reception was very poor and I asked the woman to call me back. She never did. 4th call  I was disconnected after being on hold for 20 minutes. 5th call the guy kept putting me on hold while he researched my problem and then decided I needed a reset. He had me so uncomfortable I told him I would call back. 6th call the first person asks me for my name, phone number and email. She then asked what my issue was. She then switched me to tech support and I had to provide all the same information again including my serial number. I explain my issues again and he puts me on hold. He comes back and tells me he’s windows support and heAa has to switch me to surface pro tech support. I get switched again to a nice woman in the Philippines. Again I’m asked for the same 4 pieces of information. 45 minutes later she determines that I need to send in my surface pro for repair and it will cost $450 with only a 3 month warrantee. I told her that’s absurd to charge me that much without someone actually sitting in front of it. She also told me I was not the original owner which is completely false. I purchased it 3 years ago at a local MS store.I then went to a local computer store and although it will take a few days they will diagnose the issue for free and then tell me the charge to get it repaired.I hope it’s fixable and if not I’ll purchase an Apple laptop.I own and have owned iPhones,  iPods and an iPad. You call Apple and they answer within 10 minutes and you talk to someone in the good old USA.

Tim Smith-Laing,Non-existent customer service; no way of complaining; useless,"Two months ago I spent over £1000 on a new Surface 3 Laptop. I like Windows, and use Office every day for work, so I decided to finally ditch my 5yr old Mac Air, and get a computer that could handle lots of video calls etc. for working from home. To be safe, I spent £179 on Microsoft's 'Complete' service plan.There were lots of teething problems with wifi drivers and so on that I managed to solve on my own. But there are persistent audio issues that ruin listening to music, and now Office will not run. I have been negotiating with Microsoft Support for over 3 weeks, and have never experienced such bad customer service.To be clear: the staff are helpful, polite, and doing their best. But Microsoft has set up a system designed to be slow and impenetrable, and to prevent you lodging any kind of complaint.Despite paying for Complete care, which includes what Microsoft laughably call 'advanced exchange' - which is to say, sending you a replacement for their faulty product before you return yours - they are apparently unable to offer advanced exchange. The only option is to send my laptop in and wait a week before receiving a replacement unit. So ... rather than a half-working laptop I can get by with, no laptop at all for a week.I pointed out this wasn't acceptable, pointed out I had paid for 'Complete' care, and was told they would sort advanced exchange. The original exchange was cancelled. I would get an email confirming the advanced exchange service.No email. I had to follow up 4 days later, and was told someone would call me to tell me what was going on. They did: no advanced exchange. Would I like to go back to the original unacceptable exchange system. No, I would like to be put through to complaints.Cue being told by the poor support guy that he can't do that. They literally don't have an externally accessible complaints department. Literally no way of a customer contacting customer services. He can escalate my case, which will take a week. Or, he suggests tentatively, I can try making a fuss on facebook or twitter.So: here I am. Still trying to wring service out of Microsoft and receiving none. All I want at this point is a refund. Unfortunately, I am tied to Office by work, but other than that, I will never buy a Microsoft product again.",1,2020-08-05T09:01:55.000Z

Their next suggestion was I try creating a USB recovery drive. I followed the instructions in the email they sent me but that didn't work either. Microsoft refuses to repair (even if I'm wanting to pay for said repairs) my device. Their only other option is a paid replacement for $609 plus tax. Its hugely frustrating buying an expensive device, only to discover that if something goes wrong with it, you are screwed. I tried a computer repair store, and they said they cannot work with Microsoft surfaces.

Worst customer service I've ever recieved in my life.Paid £180 for a Xbox Series 2 controller and within 2 months the inside of the controller broke, sent my controller to Frankfurt Germany like requested by Microsoft even though im in England, they promised yo replace the controller with a brand new and it'd go down as an Exchange and would take no more than 8-10 Working days. 64Days later my SAME broken controller was returned to me instead of my new controller. I have tried way too many times to get in contact to try and resolve my issue but unfortunately now they've proved to me once they've got my money they don't care and i buy a new one even though its under its warrenty.For a multi billion pound company they should be ashamed and they need to have a serious talk with customer relations",1,2020-07-23T16:36:12.000Z
Joanne Helms,Wish I didn't have to give 1 star,"Wish I didn't have to give 1 star. My bank account was charged 4 times for Microsoft purchases I did not authorize. I had to change my bank card number which caused a lot of inconvenience. I tried to contact Microsoft customer service and now 4 days later all that has been accomplished is my blood pressure increased. I am completely disgusted that I have to go through the online support site just to get a call back. First, can't understand them, second, they are all clueless and must read off a cue card because what I am asking, their responses have nothing to do with my issue. I was actually told they could not help me with researching the issue because they are working from home and not authorized to do a credit card look up. I have never in my life dealt with such a company that is so pathetic and incompetent. They should be hit with huge law suits. The last rep told me I had to go to my bank to get my money back.

Kurt,Microsoft's Laptops are junk,"I bought a new Microsoft Surface Book 2 in January 2018. It charged fully once but overnight the battery discharged completely and never held a charge again. I returned to the retailer and it was replaced with another. The replacement worked without problem for only several months before the charger failed and needed to be replaced. In March 2020 when it was 26 month’s old, with a warrantee that lasts only 24 months, the keyboard and battery in the base unit failed. Various keys got stuck on autorepeat and others would show the wrong character. The keyboard battery stopped charging altogether and has been on zero charge since. The detachable monitor needs to be charged directly as it will no longer charge while connected to the keyboard base unit (and when fully charged the much smaller battery in the monitor lasts less than an hour anyway.) If the battery gets too low on the monitor it won’t detach from the base and it needs to be released manually with a precarious and unreliable process involving shoving something into both sides of the back on the monitor to manually release the clamps. Dozens of hours were spent over several weeks on the phone to Microsoft trying to get it resolved by uninstalling and reinstalling software updates and reimaging the device. I waited weeks for them to fulfil their promise of sending a flash drive containing a fresh copy the operating system but it never arrived. They blamed COVID-19. After all attempts to fix it by resolving any software issues had failed, it was declared by Microsoft to be a hardware issue. They offered to replace the device with a used but reconditioned one for approx. $1,100. Fault-free serviceability of more than two years for a product of this type and cost is a reasonable expectation and I explained that under Australian consumer law it should be their responsibility to fix it at their expense, but they refused. I now have an expensive piece of junk that can only be used as a tablet for as long as the lousy battery will last. I will never buy another Microsoft product.  My advice is to opinion to choose a Mac anyday over Microsoft’s expensive trash. I’ve found Apple to be much more reasonable and willing to assist with out-of-warrantee claims. I would have persevered with the much inferior windows operating system and poor product quality of the of the PC but Microsoft has ensured that won’t be possible. I also note that the problems I’ve experienced are not isolated; You only need to a little searching online to find countless stories like mine. Shame Microsoft shame. If this is as good as you can do, withdraw from the PC manufacturing business altogether.",1,2020-05-18T07:36:28.000Z
neil murray,Microsoft: the worst customer service in the universe?,HiI have recently subscribed to Microsoft 365. I've been charged twice for the software. I've spent literally hours on their chat helpline trying to explain the issue to people (??) - maybe I've been talking to computers - they certainly sound like it - brainless. Needless to say my issue remains unresolved. In desperation I've written to them at their head office in the UK. No reply. Just to add insult to injury they sent me an email asking me to appraise my satisfaction in their ability to resolve my issue / complaint. Unbelievable. I responded to that email but of course there has been no reply. So my issue remains unresolved and the waste of my time continues. By the way I'm a doctor working on the front line in the current virus crisis so my time is precious. Not sure what my next move should be? Any suggestions out there? An appropriate brown solid in the mail perhaps?,1,2020-05-17T04:51:41.000Z

Soham Jain,Microsoft Xbox Controller Delivery,"Once I ordered my Xbox, I got 2 controllers for free. Although it may seem like a good deal, trust me, it ISN'T. The first controller has this TERRIBLE drift on the right analog stick that makes the controller unusable. Although I've tried every fix that I could find, the drift continues to stay. The second controller has buttons that are jammed because of how poorly the controller was made. After I ordered the third controller, it said I had to wait for 2 days for the package to come. However, 2 weeks later I received a message saying that it will most likely be delivered in 2 months (knowing Microsoft probably 2 years). Unlike Amazon, Microsoft takes FOREVER to deliver its packages, even though it receives WAY less orders. Xbox and Microsoft are cheap and the controllers should be worth $5 MAXIMUM because of how poorly they are constructed.",1,2020-05-19T22:36:21.000Z

So I checked all the accounts every Microsoft store but no gone so I ring customer support get hung up on as I have to go online to request a call????!!! So I do that speak to some guy about it go through everything even give serial number etc he then says he's investigating it and I will be on hold for a bit so I'm on hold as I think but what he did was transfer me to the completely wrong department!! So I have to explain it all again she says she can't help etc and that I need to go back and start again BTW I have hit 40to 50mins by now already! I said no I want to speak to a supervisor or manager this is out of order so reluctantly she transferred me to a supvisor had to tell him the same thing again!! He tries to transfer me straight away to the right team but surprise surprise no one is their to take my call he takes my number and says they will call me as soon as they are back I waited 2 days and nothing!!!!! So one again go through the website request a call get one and what happens a one bell call 😂 so again set it up again this time they actually call me go through all the explanation again she starts to sort it out but it must be too much hard work for her as she hangs up on me so now I'm here explaining my story of the terrible Microsoft customer service and how they have just lost 3 xbox customers as my 3boys have now officially come to Sony now I couldn't be more proud of them good bye Microsoft and good luck you will need all of it with your terrible excuse for customer service and support,1,2020-05-09T15:01:37.000Z

Suri Fineberg,If I could give zero stars I would.,"If I could give zero stars I would. My computer crashed on Friday.  After the first person tries to help me, I got disconnected.  Started all over with second person. I was told that my warranty ran out 3/20/20 and I could have an out of warranty replacement for $450, but got disconnected again.  Tried on Saturday night.  Got a different person who said my warranty expired on 5/1/20 and then went to see what he could do about the warranty, but I got disconnected when I tried to call back, they were closed.  On Sunday we spent 5 hours trying to get this done. My husband eventually decided to just buy me a new surface laptop and asked if he could have the $450 off the purchase of a new one.  We were told yes, then transferred, then disconnected, then told no.  The computer is coming tomorrow.  I am returning it as soon as it arrives.  Because last night I decided, to hell with Microsoft, and purchased my very first Apple computer.  As an owner of other Apple devices, I know that while I have to wait another week to get my computer, if I have any problems, I won’t have to go through this again.  It’s a shame because we always went to a store for our issues and never had problems. If It couldn’t be fixed we traded it in for a new one.  I loved my surface computers but that is it for me. You’ll never have to worry about a bad review from me ever again because I’ll be over at Apple (couple stores down from the Microsoft store in my local mall) purchasing all my new gadgets.",1,2020-05-04T23:52:38.000Z

Finally had to phone Microsofts premium support line and I spoke to them today, they weren't interested in what hasn't been working and have refused to remove my card details. They say this is because I am 5 days overdue for a subscription, even though I have not used the product in this time. Now I must go to my bank and request a new card so that Microsoft don't take any money. After speaking with them today I can tell you this, Microsofts support team are simple people - miserly, arrogant and rude. I can not believe they get away with talking to customers in the way they do and still have a job. Yes, it is bad enough to illicit anger. It made me very cross to have to deal with them today and actually they've made me feel like throwing this Xbox through one of their office windows, which is all it's good for to be honest. Now, it could be I'm just one angry customer but the average reveiw score says it all. Honestly, if you can avoid these guys you'll really be doing yourself a major favour.",1,2020-05-01T16:48:48.000Z
Vuitton,Awful customer service experience,"Awful customer service experience and faulty surface pro purchased in March 2020. The surface pro crashed everyday. I requested for a packing and collect label from Microsoft as advised by UPS, and it took huge effort to get any update (making calls, online chatting, emails, their FB page, etc.) Finally after a month they came back to me providing a pickup request which I already had and is not at all what I requested, not to mention endless calls I made during the month to chase. They never stick to their promised timeline to give update or answers. Decided to drop the request today to avoid wasting further time but will never buy from Microsoft again after suffering mentally from their poor product quality and customer service!",1,2020-04-30T12:50:18.000Z

Richard John,Look at everything out there before you go to a Microsoft product. They are a constant headache these days.,It is impossible to go through everthing I think is wrong with MS. The co has gone from one of the best companies with good products to the worst. I'm 79 years old and have a fair amount of experince with data processing and communications from a management standpoint. Everything they've done since Windows XP has been a downhill slide. I've not seen any change that made their operating systems better. Every windows release has gotten worse. Takes more key strokes to accomplish everything. More problems with bad programs than ever seen. I'm still running MS7 and plan on trying to eliminate MS. I have found Android on my tablet does everythinng it does do better than MS. My wife has MS10. I consider it an operating system from hell. I may look at MAC. First I'm going to try and elimiinate MS with Android. Android is coming out with more ability every day and their's usually work.Ms took over SKYPE. Every change they made meant problems. Most get fixed eventually but are a constant headache. Was a great program they did nothing for but cause aggrevation. I would look at all other options before going into any MS application to handle your systems. There is better out there without the constant problems MS has these days.,1,2020-04-25T23:56:55.000Z

Briana,THIS COMPANY IS A JOKE,"If I could leave 0 stars, I would. This company needs to be shut down. My fiance had fraudulent charges on his credit card, and after investigating through his bank, they found out that all of his bank cards that were connected to Microsoft were getting hacked and used because Microsoft was hacked a while back and his personal information must have gotten into the hands of thieves. So they suggested he reach out to Microsoft to see what they could do, since his cards were also being used to purchase Microsoft products illegally (gift cards for xbox, etc) So after getting in touch with a representative from Microsoft, they acknowledged that their were in fact fraudulent charges on his account through them & they said they would contact him back with a definitive answer on what they would do about it. So the next day, my fiance got an email from Microsoft saying that despite their being fraudulent activity through his Microsoft account, they were not refunding his money back and didn't even offer to cancel his account, change his information, nothing. So they basically admitted that they allowed fraudulent activity to occur on my fiance's account through their company, but then told him that they weren't going to do anything about it. That is the most absurd, ridiculously pathetic customer service I have witnessed in my entire life. They also forgot to mention that the fraudulent activity was set up as a recurring payment on my fiance's account so they basically were going to make my fiance PAY the FRAUDULENT CHARGES on his account every month without telling him that the fraudulent charges were recurring, instead of informing him on the extent of the situation, canceling the account and changing his personal info. Do not EVER go through Microsoft for ANYTHING. Especially if it involves any of your personal information. They do not care about the security of their customer's personal information, they don't care if your personal info ends up in the hands of theives and once it does, they won't do a single thing to help you resolve the issue. This company needs to be shut down. I hope the coronavirus pandemic puts this pathetic excuse for a company out of business.",1,2020-04-22T23:53:07.000Z

Apparently my case has been taken up by the US (highest level of support) and if this is the highest, I can't imagine how much worse it can get!. I have waited a week now, with no access to any of my Office 365 products. I get prescription notification related to my own diabetes condition and I am also looking after my father with cancer and my mother who together cannot leave their home (they used to be able to speak to me via Skype....not anymore!). The lack of empathy, understanding or the normal expectations of customer service, simply doesn't apply to Microsoft.

Lainey,Microsoft’s problems are down to it being a different person who responds each time.,"The problems with Microsoft support start right from the start, when you try to contact a human.The virtual agent gives you the run the around in loop to other sites or if it does let you select a product and issue, it doesn’t always then give you the option to contact support via the required method you need.Unfortunately that’s only a small part of the battle and much bigger issues overall.After being relieved you have finally been able to contact them, next is the issue that simple questions are not answered and the information you asked for isn’t provided and instead it’s been ignored completely and so before you know it you are lost in a never ending cycle of having to contact them again and even constantly have to prod them just for a response because they didn’t get back to you once again. There’s been times during a 5 month battle like this that I heard nothing for a month so presumed I could relax only for a response out the blue.I am sure the cause of all the problems with Microsoft ‘support’ is because each time you manage to get a response for the same issue, it’s from a completely different person and so having a case number, each time you get one of these responses they state the same standard manual like responses, rather than answer your question and require you to provide details and screenshots that you have already sent them every time you’ve responded in the past.If you do send the info again they don’t look at it properly and ask you for details again when the information is there in front of them already.This all makes it abundantly clear they aren’t looking at any of the previous emails or messages so they can’t be logging or keeping them. Thus rendering case numbers pretty irrelevant.One of their support staff tried to help at one stage by asking for contact details and the best time of day to call, I replied only for a completely different person to say thanks for my response, seemingly ignoring the details and previous message I was sent and for no one to ever call me, just state the same useless information as always.This is my experience of any of their contact methods I have tried which only makes it worse and even more complicated.All of this makes it feel like you are still speaking to their virtual assistant rather than a human being.Even before the pandemic they would send a  ‘are you still having an issue’ email, only to send a case closed email before you’ve had a chance to see it let alone respond for the millionth time.In one instance I received a case closed email a minute before I even received the ‘are you still having issues’ one. Again, this was prior to the pandemic so there is no excuse.Not only that but they were sent during the night as they don’t take non US customers into consideration and completely disregard the time difference. So there’s no chance of seeing let alone responding before they close the case.Imagine dealing with this for, as previously mentioned, 5 months and still getting no where and dreading waking up each day to a robotic, da ja vu response from another different person, having your time wasted by having to response and state everything over and over and you can imagine just how infuriating it is. Especially since most of us are dealing with enough stress from far bigger things away from our Microsoft accounts or products.",1,2020-05-30T17:59:05.000Z

The processing power is garbage, half the time excel, one-note and all of the other of Microsofts 'useful' apps don't work half the time. But at least I can play candy crush. at least I can use the computer for 15-20 minutes intervals before it crashes unexpectedly. I have to say, probably the only 'GOOD' thing about Microsoft is its commands but even that isn't accurate half the time. nothing else. NOTHING! Microsoft teams may be secure but it is GOOD. half the time, files won't load, screens will bug, images will freeze and ill get a notification saying that ms teams aren't responding.

Erica Weckle,My 2 & 1/2 Hour Phone Call: Transferring is Incorrect and Problem Unresolved,"I'm having issues logging into my Minecraft game. It's a simple password reset that I require. Each representative has been helpful & tried to assist me, but the overall experience has been very annoying & downright frustrating. I was transferred 5 times & they were all to the wrong department (they said PC Games but I don't end there).The following is exactly what I have been through:1. When I initially called, I had to deal with an automated system that sent me in circles a couple of times b4 finally sending me to the tech department to speak with a human about my issue.2. B4 getting a hold of the 1st person, I was on hold for roughly 20-25 mins. Now, I'm generally not one to complain about the wait time. I understand right now there's a high volume of calls bc of the current stay-at-home order. However, this wait time is only the 1st of many & adds annoyance to the overall experience.3. When I got through to the Window Tech Help (I believe that's the name of the department), I talked to Russel (again, I think that's his name). He had me reset my Microsoft account password (I don't have any issue with my Microsoft, it was my Minecraft). He believed this would fix the problem as he THINKS the Microsoft account info, & the Minecraft account info is the same. The reset of my Microsoft password didn't fix the issue, so he transferred me to the PC Game Help.4. After waiting on hold for about 10 to 20 mins, Kevin picked up. He was NOT PC Game Help; he was Xbox Help. However, Kevin tried to help me but was unsuccessful. So, he said he was going to transfer me to PC Games Help (the second time I was supposed to be transferred to that department).5. Another 10 to 20-min hold & I was contacted to another representative. He didn't give me his name but did tell me he was at Windows Tech Help. He had me log into my Microsoft (probably thinking that Microsoft = Minecraft) & then try to log into my Minecraft account. I was successful with my Microsoft account (NOT THE ACCOUNT I need help with) but UNSUCCESSFUL with my Minecraft account (THE ACCOUNT I NEED help with). He was unable to resolve my problem & put me on hold to be transferred to the PC Games Help.6. Fifteen mins later & surprise, surprise, I'm once again back at the Windows Help. I didn't catch the new representative's name. However, he did say my Minecraft account was Microsoft account. I tried to log in to my Minecraft account using my Microsoft info but had no luck. He put me on hold once more to check with PC Games Help (I believe) & told me it would be a 2-4 min wait.7. After the hold, he came back asked if I had been in contact with someone at Mojang. I haven't, hence why I'm contacting Microsoft. I explained that I have made 2 separate tickets: 1 for help & 1 to report that I wasn't receiving emails when I attempted to reset my password. I have also attempted to reset my password through the Minecraft website several different times over the past 2 days. He gave me another number to contact Mojang & put me on hold to be transferred to PC Games once more.8. Another 10 to 20-min hold (I've stopped counting how long), a woman picked up & I was back at WINDOWS HELP! My call has been going for close to 2 hours now. I explained my situation & she gave me 2 more numbers to contact Mojang at (why are there so many different numbers?). Then she said she would transfer me to the 'correct' department (PC Games) & parted ways.9. Another hold & I'm back at Windows Help & talking to another woman. An explanation of the situation (with heavy frustration) & it's clear that she can't do anything. I request to speak to a manager & I'm put on hold once more.10. The same person comes back & they said their supervisor is tied up & can't assist me. At this time, we are discounted. She calls me back, but there is nothing she can do. I say goodbye & hang up.The overall experience is frustrating & annoying. In the end, my problem was not resolved and I have to call Mojang.",1,2020-04-09T20:27:25.000Z
Elena Brewer,Microsoft needs better customer…,"Microsoft needs better customer support. I've had the worst encounter with customer support telling me to do the same thing I've been doing on different platforms, only to tell me the same thing the website has been telling me.   I was trying to change a primary email alias account to a different one that was already assigned, and it wouldn't let me, giving a red text error limiting changes until the next week.They also refused to changed the information for me due to ""Privacy and Security"" reasons, but that shows they could change it. Are they just there to provide obvious answers then? What is the point of Customer Service? ALSO, Mind you on the website, it tells you you can change your email account to a primary ANY TIME you want. This is a lie of course cause I change it once and all of a sudden I am limited to changing it until not one, not two days, BUT A WHOLE WEEK. Nice security Microsoft. It's highly unnecessary.

My experience with Microsoft was quite  disappointing. Their customer service completely sucks and so does their website in general. I had a problem with canceling my subscription and after a phone call with an employee, an online chat, and reading and re-reading the cancel directions on their site, my subscription still wasn’t canceled. If you are thinking about purchasing a subscription or anything from this site, I would strongly advise you not to. It will be extremely difficult to cancel anything. It really surprises me that a company this popular and developed has such disrespect for their customers. I will NEVER use or buy anything from this company again.

Having spent thousand of pounds on Surface computers over the years, for both work and personal use, I have a top of the range SP4 at home which only recently started to have the ""screen scramble"" issue.The only option to speak to a support person is to have a call back. Had to go through this four times before I managed to speak someone, other times calls disconnected and there was no attempt to call me again.Finally through, I was told that this is a very common issue with the SP4 and MS had extended the 1yr warranty to 3yrs as a result - something I paid extra for when I bought the Surface originally! Because mine was recently out of warranty, I would have to pay over £560 for a replacement device which would be a Pro 5 as they no longer make the 4. There were no other options.£560 for what is a three year old model? Wowee. It is a high end model but I can buy it for around the same price online and keep this one which works perfectly for 30-45mins!Look forward to the new OSX like iPad which I believe will be what I will be replacing this, and the company SP's with.",2,2020-04-03T07:59:29.000Z

Then the automated voice just randomly hung-up on me.

I just bought most recent system last year in December and as of March 2020 it won’t even load past the Xbox Screen.I have tried multiple ways of contacting Xbox/Microsoft support team and have yet to hear anything.

Online chat forces you to log in to speak to an advisor thus making that unusable as well as they wont send me my codes. So literally any customer with a login issue for Microsoft products CAN NOT contact Microsoft or fix the issue, its literally impossible.This service is an absolute joke, a 4 year old could have designed a better method for helping customers..

After two days, I received an email telling me that my account did not have sufficient information to recover my password.  The alternative was to call the Microsoft Team.  I was put on hold for 3 hours.  Upon speaking to a representative my call was immediately disconnected after being promised that we would not disconnect.  I called back the number and after an additional 1 hour of waiting was connected to a new representative.  This should be a simple problem to resolve yet I was told by this rep that I needed to speak to an entirely separate department to recover my password.  Once again, ARCHAIC process that blows my mind is still being used in 2020 to recover a password.  Once more, after waiting an additional hour I was disconnected.

For the price tag I would've expected better customer service.I will return it after only 1 month. I can't trust it with bigger issues.,1,2020-07-13T09:48:10.000Z
Oliver.,Absolute crap,"Absolute crap. Customer service is unhelpful, particularly concerning XBox and Password recovery. So disappointed that I can’t even begin to describe. Started out liking them, but now I hate everything about their company.",1,2020-07-13T06:43:05.000Z
Bryan Lott,Will continue to buy Apple Products. Microwave sucks all around,"Spoke with a customer service rep over online chat, horrible communication skills. This man had NO CLUE what I was asking him. I needed to find a way to restore some word documents from my Mac. This man kept repeating there wasn’t anything he could do personally but have me read the one drive help page. Which is what I did, with no help, which is why I started a chat. He kept sending the link to me anytime I asked a question, it’s like he had no idea what I was saying or even asking. I finally asked him to end the chat so I could give them some feedback, which he just asked maybe the next question I can help you with. Anyways, after about 30 min of me sitting there waiting for it to end, He finally asked if I needed anything else and if not he will end the chat. And there was no type of review anywhere. So that’s what brought me here. This is why I buy Apple products. They have the best customer service, even if they can’t help you, they will set up everything for you to get seen at an Apple store. Apple will always exceed Microsoft",1,2020-07-12T12:33:48.000Z
Per,"A truly horrific, Kafka-like hardware support experience","Short summary: Never, EVER again a hardware device from Microsoft.I bought a Surface Book 2 a while ago, in my opinion a quite expensive, premium product. So I would expect some premium support if there is a problem with the device. How naive I was.I have been regularly experiencing the dreadful BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death) for quite some time (maybe even from the beginning, hard to tell because it is very random to its nature - typical hardware symptoms in my non-professional opinion). I get in contact with support who ask me to run some diagnostic tool and send in the logs. So I do what they ask me to, I even attach some mobile photos of the blue screen including the error codes causing it. I get an answer that I should re-image the device. Oh no, sounds like a lot of work. And I am not convinced that it would actually solve anything, but I do it in hope of it supporting my case. I get a question back if I have seen any more blue screens. No, not in the last couple of days or a week or so.Supports answer:""You have just confirmed that with our image the device does not have the symptoms for over a week.We can determine that the problem does not come from the device because with the Original build there is no issue.""I have been trying to tell them that it is randomly occuring BSODs, which cannot be veryfied as solved just because they do not occur for a short period of time, both before and after I got this answer.So I open a new case, referring to the old case and start to explain my frustration and point out the very strange logic that closed the former case. It takes a lot of messages, time, pain and frustration, but eventually they agree to replace the device. So I get a replacement ticket, just in time for Corona to enter the scene. I need to work from home and thus need the device, even though it occationally BSOD (replacing in this case means sending in the device and wait for the delivery service and then MS to do their thing, I'm estimating it to be in total a couple of weeks or so without the device).Now two months later (warrenty is still active, allthough you could argue that the case should be open since the beginning several months back) I am going for vacation so it would be a great time to send in the device to get a replacement. The replacement order was closed because I didn't act on it. So I open a new case, refer to the cases above where someone at the support organization already agreed to replace the device because of hardware malfunction, and ask for a new replacement order.Nope, I have to start diagnosing the device again. And they start talking about re-imaging, which I have already done twice. After almost a week of trying to fight for my rights, I finally get connected to a technical guy who reads my system events and I get this answer:""For: Bad Pool header looks related to the hard drive, I presume this has happened on multiple occasions even before re-image?For: System Thread Exception Not Handled, checked the System file what it is about, has to do with the graphics. Do you remember if this happened before the re-image was done or even last year?If this also happened before we can replace the Surface.""Does that mean that it is ok with a defect harddrive? That I can only get a replacement if the problem with the graphics occurred before the re-image? Why wasn't the answer ""we will send you a replacement device ASAP""? Which would have been the answer from an organisation who actually cares about their customers.This last happend this week, so I am per today still waiting to get my device replaced. Only the future can tell...EDIT: After a lot of pain and high blood pressure, I finally got the device replaced. It took a lot of emailing back and forth, and several months to finally get the repacement for a device that from my point of view was obviously flawed. My opinion on Microsoft hardware hasn't really changed, I will keep to brands who cares about their customers in the future.",1,2021-04-29T08:20:06.000Z

Vivian,The reviews below are spot on,"The reviews below are spot on. Microsoft is too big of a company (and earning too much money for that matter) to have such bad customer service. I was having an issue with their website some months back. It wasn't showing any devices on my account. Which was out of the ordinary because my Xbox 360 had been listed on my account from the time I purchased and registered it on their website until that month when it mysteriously disappeared. Contacting customer service is torture in itself because you cannot DIRECTLY contact them. You're either stuck with a robot or you have to ask fellow Microsoft consumers for any resolutions. I spoke to a woman named, Hannah, who was very patient and understanding. Unfortunately, she had no idea what was going on with my account and the problem, so she gave me 2 numbers to contact customer service. 1 number was pointless because after going through the automated voice, she tells you to call another number and it hangs up. Called the other number and you have to go through so many transfers. At the last transfer, not only did it sound like she was on a farm or out in the wilderness somewhere (because all I kept hearing was chicken and rooster noises in the background) but after telling her my problem, she said to me, ""Well, what do you want me to do about it?"" She came off as real sassy and snappy. She fixed the issue, but I could have done without the attitude.Their Microsoft ""rewards"" is pretty pointless to me as well. You don't really win anything. I log into my account every morning and do the rewards, and I've only been able to get $10 3 times out of the year that I've been doing it (and that goes to my Xbox Live because regardless of how much you paid for the console, regardless of how much you pay for extra video games, Xbox live being free is unheard of by them.) Not to mention the many times their servers go down and people have switched to Playstation because they don't have problems. It's just a lackluster experience all the way around when it comes to Microsoft.",2,2020-07-08T14:37:28.000Z

I was sent back and forth between departments because each person said they couldn't solve the issue. I also had representatives say they would call me back about the issue and they never did.

The acknowledgement automated email contains a warning to refrain to send any further inquiry as it will only result in slowing down the reply.Unbelievable. I pay this company 80£/year for a subscription I cannot access because they have no personnel to attend this type of inquiries.

I called the Microsoft Help line for assistance. Because it’s out of warranty, the only “fix” they can recommend is for me to buy a new Surface! I paid $800 for this Surface! I would expect that it would last for more than 3 years! I believe that this a sub-standard product. I’ve read many many reviews about the issues it’s had. It’s hard to believe that a company as successful as Microsoft would not stand behind their product. The right thing to do is either fix it or provide another one. These were not options for me. I have tried talking to several different people over the past week. No one is available to speak to here in the U.S. BTW!

Second of all you have no freedom on xbox live as a 15 year old.

Beautiful Vermillion,I purchased a game that did not…,I purchased a game that did not download I was on the phone for an entire day from 9am to 5pm! So I filed a Dispute because they could not figure out why there was a trouble shoot. Over a month passed and they closed my Dispute with no awnser/solution or reason as of why it was closed and why my game never downloaded. I have wasted money with Xbox with memberships and passes and games. There customer service is highly unprofessional. One agent was laughing at my frustration and another kept telling me we will contact you. It is 2020 and it is not listed on there sight for me to refund so after a couple of months it disappears from games purchased list. I purchased the game in September 2019 and I tired to file a refund in October 2019 but as I said was not there. The fact that you have to file a refund when agents clearly saw there was an error and I did purchase the game. So sad to see Microsoft go south withing the past two years. Guess I'm going back to Playstation. Now I'm being told its reopen why is this taking so long Never again.,1,2020-01-03T15:58:03.000Z

Scratched off the silver panel to reveal code and tried to redeem the code and was told by Microsoft Setup to use an office product where registration process would be completed.  This kept referring me to Office 365 subscriptions which I didn't want.  Turns out this is because Home & student is not compatible with a chrome book.  Called Microsoft to change over the subscription to Office 365.  Yes sir, just pay £79.99 and you can have 3 month free.  I refused so they said take it back to PC World for a refund.  Why would PC World refund a code card that has been used, I asked.  Microsoft said they won't but if you don't want our offer then you brought it from there so take it up with them.  I then asked them to transfer the licence to a different email address so that I could use the wasted card on a lap top of mine.  Sorry Sir we can't do that!!!!!  I tried everything for them to be reasonable but they refused everything I offered and told me to pay more money to get less.

B,No longer trust products but support is amazing,"I’ve always been an Apple product user but when the Surface Pro 4 came out, I decided to switch because I was starting school again and liked the idea of a computer and tablet in one. I purchased it about 3 years ago when it was a little over $1000. Not having owned it for a year, I had the display give out on me where it kept flickering. Luckily it was still under warranty and I got a replacement. A little less than 2 years into this replacement, I have the exact same issue happen along with the type cover not being detected. Turns out that this is a common issue among all the Surface Pro 4’s. About 3 other of my classmates with Surface Pro 4’s all had the same issue with the screen too and all owning it for less than 2 years. Since this was a known issue, Microsoft had a replacement program for this problem. They no longer make the Surface Pro 4’s so I was sent a refurbished one even though I told them I was hesitant about receiving a refurbished one because if this is a known issue, what’s to say it won’t happen again? In less than 2 months, my type cover is no longer detectable nor my Surface pen…kind of defeats the entire purpose of this product. I’ve given up on this and support has told me that there hasn’t been any known issues with the other Surface generations but I’ve had the worst luck with this. It’s frustrating to me as a student with way too much debt that a $1000 computer can’t even last 3 years (I don’t even use heavy programming since its main purpose is for school). My Macbook Pro is more than 8 years old but yet it works better than this Surface Pro. I don’t plan on going back to Microsoft products. However, the support there has been amazing and trying to help me with all these issues so great on customer service. I could possibly be convinced just on the customer service alone to go back but Apple not only has great products that last long, but just as amazing customer service if not better.",2,2019-12-25T20:00:22.000Z

You know, the back in the day service that ensure you were not taking your business else where and such. I just fixed the blue loop of death with the help of a level two tech calling from the customer service number. An appointment made with in a week of the initial call and around a busy Christmas even. Now I can be a handful and i do not keep my mouth shut when upset. I will be honest, even when happy I have a habit of getting louder and louder with no options of mute .. hehe. So after having several people assist me that resulted in a working computer again I must say I am impressed. Most by now would of hung up on me or redirected me ... etc, until I just move on.

I didn't want to make a complaint or write anything negative online or on social media, despite threatening it.

Tyler Berglund (Almost Zone Coverage),Avoid dealing with this company if you can.,"I ordered a Windows Mixed Reality headset from the Microsoft store and was told it would arrive a week later. Fast forward to a week later and all I can see is that my order is pending so I decide to contact Microsoft support. After spending 40 minutes on hold, I was greeted by someone who wasn’t capable of solving my problem. They then passed me to a representative by the name of James who assured me that my order would be shipped out in a timely manner and I would receive the tracking number within an hour or two. Needless to say, none of this was true. The rep flat out lied to me and cancelled my order instead of helping me, this is an unacceptable business practice and as far as I’m concerned, Microsoft itself is at fault for this for not providing good, or any customer service for that matter. I will be avoiding this company like the plague if this is what the future looks like for Microsoft. They have zero interest in helping their customers. Unacceptable.Edit: I have been a long time supporter of Microsoft (over 10 years) but this has me very skeptical of what the future holds for Microsoft.

Ross Adams,Once Drive 1TB data lost by a software robot,"They lost all my 1TB of OneDrive  data. The issue started In August 2019 .A software robot decided to block/ lock me out of my Onedrive and my microsoft account / my entire microsoft account with no explanation. I paid £79 p year for Onedrive . I had it for two years now and they have blocked my account with no explanation at all plus they billed me for the next year to add insult to injury . Not even paypal can get my money back even though I am within UK laws 14 days refund cooling-off period for this year , this is how giant companies behave. .Ironically all my data is still shared in the cloud so it's obviously a robot that decided and NOT a human. So when Artificial intelligence eventually (soon) rules the world then expect something akin to the film The Terminator since the present robots are useless, some people will end up as NONE citizens because some algorithm has decided ( computer says NO) . I have spent months now trying to hunt for a REAL person to speak to but to my horror story , there is no way on earth to contact anyone in Microsoft accounts because ironically you need an Unblocked account to even email them. How stupid is that? So beware if you lose access to your one drive because they lock you out, then they Blank you NEVER talk to you again. Then all your data WILL be lost or inaccessible ( in my case I can access some shared links I kept, thus proving no human has closed my account 2 months later). I would recommend like me you also back it all up to a local hard drive every so often but move to a cloud storage company who actually speaks to you if they have an issue. Of course i will never use them again. Its been 2 months now with zero contact from them and no matter how many times I fill in the form, the numb nuts automated system never replies and they never fix it, and I end up in going in telephone circles trying to access or find a real person to help me.They have recently taken an auto PayPal payment I had not canceled and not even Paypal would not help with a refund even though I am within my 14 day cooling off time which is UK law.

Love And Legacy (Love and Legacy),DO NOT SHOP WITH MICROSOFT,"Microsoft is a horrible company who puts out really bad products!  I have a Surface pro 5 that I bought May 2017.  I have had to replace this device three times with me paying each time even if I was in my warranty.  I have had to replace the pen three times with me paying each time. I had to replace the Keyboard twice with me paying.  I have had to replace the charger four times with me paying and now I have to replace the charger again.I had a huge life changing presentation I was to conduct yesterday but woke up to my charger not working again.  I called Microsoft from 6AM - 9 AM, got a text for online support for my mobile device and even went online to try to get tech support or an answer as to why this keeps happening.  Nothing microsoft has in place got me to the correct location so I called Microsoft Billing and made them transfer me over to tech support to ensure I speak to someone.  After hours of trying to get in contact with tech support I finally was connected, just to be told because my computer is out of warranty the power cord I bought spring 2019 cant be replaced for free and they require me to pay another $79.99 for a power cord I already paid to replace 4 previous times.  I bought this power cord separate so what does my warranty have to do with my 2019 purchase?  Then I research and find out Microsoft knows the power cords are bs and put a recall out on surface pro 3&4 but not anything newer products despite the thousands of complaints regarding these faulty power cords.  I spent $1594.00 on my surface pro 5 and then spent an additional $1102.89 total between 2017-2019 due to Microsofts faulty products!  For this price I could get a Macbook and have way less issues.  I see all of the reviews and I believe a class action suit should be filed against Microsoft forcing them to pay back all the money they are stealing from consumers and they should be forced to sell quality products.  It is a felony to steal anything over $100 so why is it okay for a multimillion dollar company to steal from its consumers by putting out bs products and making the consumer pay to replace knowing it will break sooner than later.  I had one power cord break after three weeks and my keyboard stopped working out of no where, when I took it to microsoft they said oh we have no clue why it broke but here is a new one for a fee.  We should all report Microsoft to consumer reporting affairs, BBB and file a class action suit against them.  I am contacting an attorney today to find out what can be done and I am switching over to Mac.  Its sad because I have $10k in Microsoft products picked out for my companies upgrade next year but after all of this, no thank you keep your bs products and stop ripping people off aren't you wealthy enough????",1,2019-11-27T14:46:25.000Z

Please come back and fix this.  It is unconscionable that a company could allow its customers to be treated so poorly. I have spent hours and hours and hours and hours on the phone and in chat sessions with Microsoft trying to get them to fix a mistake they made. And guess what. It is still not fixed. Awful.

I can buy the same software locally for £29.99. 2. They were never given my credit card details. There was a renewal pre-payment authorisation generated for PayPal when the software was registered but I cancelled that. This is currently under investigation and the good news is the card company just refunded the payment. Microsoft are also blocked from the account. I still can't figure out how they got the card details, which is rather worrying.",1,2020-02-18T09:53:31.000Z
Harold Reeves,I can't wait to buy an Apple PC.,"My computer was updated on Tuesday and is almost worthless now as it has taken me until  now, 4.45  Saturday 15/02/2020 to actually get it working again . There is no way of getting any useful help from technical services that actually works. Last year I was on to them at least three times after updates gave me problems. On one occasion a very nice young lady spent eighteen hour s trying to fix the problem without success. Another time an ""experienced "" technician told me he had fixed it but what he didn't tell me was that he had re-partitioned my hard drive  and ,of course, I lost a huge amount of work so I don't trust Microsoft technicians at all. I was on to technical services before this and the system now is that you have to fill in your credit card details before you get help. Well no thank you, having had the awful help I have had in the past I don't think so.My computer is due for scrapping soon even though up to today I didn't have an insurmountable problem, I will be buying Apple.Windows 10 would be brilliant but for the updates.

I ALREADY CALLED TECH SUPPORT. IT SHOULD JUST BE THAT ONE CALL AND WAITING TIME!JUST HAVE US CONFIRM WHAT REGION WE ARE IN THROUGH AUTOMATION VS HAVING TO GO TO SOMEONE JUST TO BE REDIRECTED AGAIN. RIDICULOUS MICROSOFT!But....Once I FINALLY got to tech support. I was livid, man. I told the guy (Micheal) I REFUSE to pay anything before I get the proper help because I am NOT willing to pay any money for more of a run around.When I told him how frustrated I was he was super understanding, and even offered me the 3 Month Trial of MS Office for free!! Which I REALLY appreciate!! (it made the pain of everything I went through at least seem heard and understood which is already Awesome!)NOTE: Microsoft you BETTER NOT take that ability away from Tech Support because I swear if it wasn't for him doing that I would've just went STRAIGHT to apple and Ditched your service FOR GOOD.But Ontop of that, he was super patient. I let him Quick Assist to my desktop and once he was in control I let him go through it all with me. and GUYS HE WAS A CHAMPION! MICHEAL PULLED THROUGH!It took 2 and Half HOURS for him to figure it out and he was RELENTLESS! He got plenty of help from his uppers, and I really appreciate all the trouble he went through. Micheal if you're reading this, You are #1 dude. I hope other Tech Support works like you dude, super patient and chill about it all. and also really humble. He tried SO MANY different ways to fix my problem and by the time it was fixed he was honest in telling me that it really could've been a variety of different things that were awry but couldn't exactly pin point the Issue. And you know what, I really freakin' appreciate him and the way he handled and communicated EVERYTHING to me.Honestly Micheal Restored my hope in Tech Support, and I can Confidently say if it weren't him I'd give up on Windows and Microsoft completely.. Now I've got everything working properly, even Cleaner then before! Plus I understand a lot more about how the issue came up which is a HUGE plus imo! Because of that ONE Tech Support, Micheal L, I will sticking with Microsoft products heck I'll even keep myself subscribed for future updates.

I will try to do it through the bank instead and hope that this works, and hopefully Microsoft realise they have still taken 1 payment and don't cut off the account. If they do, it may be a good opportunity to switch to Apple as have been thinking about it for while! Microsoft have caused issues for a while with regular updates without asking, and some programmes we run becoming incompatible with new updates and creating issues and extra work.

Doyathink hesawus,Faulty Xbox One experience,"Xbox one broken within 6 months of minimal use. Contacted customer support who advised me that I needed a replacement but wanted to hold onto £400 of my money until they recieved the faulty one. Ended up with a warranty repair job which took 3 weeks not 7-10 days as stated by Microsoft. It took 8 days through their selected courier to get to them so obvious the timescale wasn't a true indication. It was sent in its original box as well. I recieved the xbox back in a plain white box. After querying where my original box had gone they told me that they don't send them in the original boxes for security reasons....... Then after a short battle passed the buck of to the courier UPS stating that they package it. I now have a severely devalued repaired xbox one with no original box. Also had to pay out for a hdmi lead because they failed to return that. I won't ever buy an xbox again, rubbish customer service and they don't value their customers.

Customer,WORST WORST WORST billing experience…,"WORST WORST WORST billing experience ever! On one occasion on April 28, 2019, after arguing with customer service on the phone for 40 min, they overbilled me for Office 365 Personal AND did not provide the services I paid for. A customer service rep argued with me and bullied me emotionally, mentally and financially and wasted 40 min of my time (worth $40 at my pay rate) and REFUSED REPEATEDLY to correct their accounting system error which affects not just me but most likely all their customers. I proved to her that they had an error over the phone and offered to send her additional proof, such as screenshots and email I have received from them as proof that they have systematic accounting error that affects possibly all their clients and she STILL refused to understand the truth and she STILL refused to receive the proof and continued to insist I was wrong and continued to  bully me. I have never been abused so much by a customer service rep before!!!!!!!!!!!! All I was trying to do is pay for one additional month of service and in gratitude for my continued support of over 2 years, they stole my money and gave me the abuse of a lifetime!On another occasion before that, I paid for a movie which did not play on my Windows 7 laptop and they would not refund the money. All other movie services play perfectly on Windows 7, except for Microsoft. How ironic! You don't honor your own software.Dear Microsoft Representative, who receives these reviews at Microsoft, please check my account and correct these mistakes. The name on the account is Svetla Morozova. You can hear the recorded call from your customer service reps and I can also provide a recording of this call from my call recording app which records all my calls automatically. Please especially correct your systemic accounting error as it likely affects all your Office 365 Personal clients and movie viewers, may be for other subscription services as well. It is only on your customer service reps screens, not on my screen. On my screen is correct and they refuse to accept that it is correct on my screen and wrong on theirs. What is wrong is the expiration date of my paid subscription for Office 365 Personal. On their screen it says my paid subscription expires on April 3, 2019 and on my screen it says it expires on May 3, 2019. I paid/prepaid as usual on April 1, 2019 for an entire month and of course I still have service as of today April 28, 2019, which is proof that I have prepaid an dthe info on my screen is correct, plus I received an email with the same expiration date. I believe the reason you have an issue on your customer service side is that their accounting system considers the 30-day free trial as part of the PAID subscription and this skews their accounting system by 30 days. Please correct it!!!! Also, please make it possible for me to make a one time payment online for a subscription. This is not available and should be. You only do auto-pay and not manual month-by-month payments. You should have both. Sometimes we want to pay manually and not on autopay. This is why I had to call customer service today trying to process a one-time payment for an extra mont of service from May 3-June 3, 2019, which was not an option online, and instead they wasted 40 min of my life and abused me and processed my payment without extending my subscription until June 3, 2019. It is still until May 3, 2019 on my screen despite paying for an extra month today and today's payment is already showing on my screen, but the expiration date has not changed. Please have my account adjusted so that my screen shows my subscription expires on June 3, 2019 after making a monthly payment today. They said, they will extend my expiration date to June 3, 2019 after making the payment today and they did not do what they said they will. Please make sure all these systemic accounting issues and your customer service bad attitude and client bullying does not continue. Please offer payment for the bullying and emotional, mental and financial distress (minimum $6,000) and lost time for the phone call and submitting another request for your customer service here of (40 min for call plus 55 min for this request, total of 95 min at $60/hour, would be $95). Total damages so far are $6,095. Please contact me to pay them immediately. If you cannot extend my subscription expiration date to June 3, 2019 for some technical reason, please refund today's payment and fix your technical issue or extend my sibscription by giving me a free month. It has to be the same subscription, because otherwise millions of dollars of data will be deleted from my OneDrive service which is bundled with the Office 365 Personal subscription as one payment for both services. You have 24 hours to solve this and make payment of $2,095 for the damages so far. Contact me to receive the bank account where I will receive your ACH payment for damages today. Please do not make me call you again. You call me if you need to solve this. Best wishes!",1,2019-04-29T02:11:39.000Z

Called their support number, the person that answered couldn't help and I need to get to sales.  Transferred to the Sales Department, they couldn't help because it was for Commercial Sales, transferred to on-line support, first rep, could not assist as it was a troubleshooting issue, transferred to another rep whose phone was so inaudible I could barely hear what he was saying.  Finally I got an answer, I could issue a return with the rep (who couldn't be understood because his phone was pure static) but he could not guarantee that I would receive a new computer, but would probably received a refurbished, working computer.  Mind you this was all within their 30 day return policy for any reason.  Second option was to physically return the computer to a brick and mortar store, which is 45 minutes to 1 hour away.After 1 hour and 20 minutes on the phone with this NO SERVICE company,my only option to get it resolved was to go to a physical store.

But the customer support was very very bad. Not only that they didn't give me a refund but they really made me upset regarding all the time I spent in vain and the way they treated me.I have only one product and it should be as simple as ever just to receive the money back for something that you never wanted to buy but not at Microsoft.It took quite some time to find a chat and log in and wait for the person to connect to you. Then for about 20 minutes this employee was asking for more time and for more time and for more time. Every time for 2-3 minutes and did not give any answer until I asked them and it was again. No intentioe ever to give a refund.After 20 minutes of it I said that if you cannot get an answer from people who are responsible for the refund I would like to initiate a charge back because I do not like when a person at Microsoft is simply lieing to me in hope that I will disconnect at some point in time.At that time they said ""yes, it is a better thing for us as we indeed cannot receive an answer from the refund team"".

mevrouw van Egmond,Don't switch to Microsoft!,"A year ago, I made the switch from an Apple Macbook Pro to a Microsoft Surface Pro. Unfortunately, in my experience, this has been a very dreadful experience.I am happy with the software of the computer, yet the hardware has shown many flaws and simply a lack of quality. This combined with the poor service or even the lack of service that Microsoft offers, I am very disappointed.Three months after I purchased the Surface Pro Tablet, Keyboard and Pen, the mousepad in the keyboard stopped working. After sending it in for a check, I received my money back in the form of a gift card (!?) after 4 weeks! In the meantime, of course, I had already bought a new keyboard...Six months later, the plastic surrounding the tip of the Microsoft Pen broke. Even though I barely used the pen... After trying to contact Microsoft (25 minutes in a paid phone waiting line without an answer, multiple emails, tweets and Facebook messages) I found out that in the meantime, my guarantee period had expired. A clever move of Microsoft not to respond?The Surface collection is an expensive collection, but due to its poor quality, it becomes extremely expensive to keep covering the costs. Within one year I purchased 1 Surface Tablet, 2 Surface Keyboards and 1 Surface Pen and I will now probably have to repurchase the latter as well...I'd say: save yourself the hassle and don't take a Microsoft laptop!",1,2019-09-14T10:38:06.000Z

vinoop v,My Surface book doesn't power on from sleep mode after 3 months.,"bought Microsoft Surface book in mid of November 2018 from John Lewis, and by March 1st week, it stopped working, I mean, not booting up from the sleep mode even after having 90% charge.. I kept the device for 2 hours for charging and tried switching on again, and it booted up, and meanwhile I contacted the Microsoft support, and they did some diagnostics and said that the battery is faulty and the device needs to be replaced. But to my surprise they are saying that, they can only give a refurbished laptop, not a new one , as it is beyond the 30 days period., and as per their policy, they don't give away a new surface book.I have paid £1299 for the new surface book, and now they are saying that they can only give a refurbished one, which I am annoyed of. Even though its a manufacturing fault. I am not happy with the resolution, as getting exchanged with a refurbished laptop, even after purchasing a new Microsoft surface book from John Lewis.This is service ticket number for the same : SRX1464646050ID",1,2019-03-12T10:11:52.000Z

Which is not the case, it's just their lame system recognizing my machine as a different one because of the hardware replacement.I will start using OpenOffice to avoid these issues when I need it for work.I bought a Surface book pro and several Microsoft products in the last years, but this is a mind changing situation. I won't buy nor recommend any of their products anymore.It took me so long to jump from Apple to Microsoft and I thought it was a good option since they are focusing on the creativity market.

Of course since it was a custom install I cannot go back to previous version.Then she says I cannot have my office installed because her records only show my mac version.

Megan Lowry-Smith,I'd rate it 0 if possible.,"I'd rate it 0 if possible.I had bought 4 xbox games off of Microsoft website before Christmas 2018, one had arrived in the mail and we had gotten a call about one out of stock. No big deal it happens. We waited for the other 2 games and they never showed up and we never got and shipping info about them. I called and asked about this and after finally getting a hold of someone they said that they were online copies of the the games. We then asked for a refund because that wasn't what we wanted and there was no mention of this on the website when placing an order for said games. She gave us the run around putting us on hold for 10 minutes and transferring us around in a circle until she told us that they cant do anything about it it's an xbox issue and to call them. So I did. I was then told it wasn't an xbox issue but I could fill out a form to get a refund if approved. It wasn't... I was told to call Microsoft again so I did and she told me to just call my bank and file a dispute. It's not my banks fault that it wasn't advertised to be an online copy only. I didnt download the games or anything. I just wanted a refund. They now aren't replying to emails or messages so I've had to dispute this with my bank and I'm still going through that process. It's been 3 months of stress because they wouldn't refund me my money after not advertising the games properly. They aren't even worth one star. Will never be buying from them again or recommending them to anyone I know. I will be going out of my way to tell people to avoid them if I hear them talking about Microsoft because their customer service is that bad.",1,2019-02-09T00:14:43.000Z
Christopher Pearse,Xbox seems to be scamming people,"Xbox seems to be scamming people into their promotions aswell and then not delivering. For example xbox had a promotion for gamepass plus sling tv. Sounds like a good deal ok lets click on this on our console..... Ok cant see any other info on this lets go a step further.... Ok its just talking about game pass. We must have missed something. Lets start from the beginning...... Ok again only mentions game pass. Well maybe it is just a super awesome deal with no restrictions, i hate game pass but am super interested in checking out sling so why not lets pay for it and check things out. Ok its done awesome. No info on sling though. Lets download sling. Ok it wants my card number for a 7 day trial........ Ooookkkk probably have to set up an accout lets just get through it. Ok all done were on a 7 day trial though instead of the month xbox promised. 2 days later i start getting frustrated and decide to try and call xbox it is then and only then i get the answer im looking for. I am not eligable because ive hade gamepass before........................ WTh.... Im sure ive doubled and tripple checked that promotion a thousand times on my xbox one why the heck did it not mention any of this??? My theory xbox has gone down the drain. They decide not to reveal this information on your consoles so that they can scam you into paying for things and not have to actually give them to you. Its pure profit. When i confronted this to xbox they say its in their news letter............ Double WTh....... So im expected to do extensive research before i buy anything through my xbox one. Why not just put this info attached to the promotions. Back to my previous answer i guess. This isnt the first time xbox scammed me with non working dlc content for fallout 4, lying promotions about how you can download the latest version of minecraft free through the xbox store and now this. BTW i was denied a refund for the dlc content wich cost over $50 and the minecraft which cost me $30 several times infact they just stoped responding to me completely by continuing to close each case i open almost as soon as i open it. I now have unworking dlc content aswell as 2 versions of minecraft that i bought in 1 day. Yup 2 minecrafts 1 day................... Why even try and request another refund. Microsoft doesnt care. Thats why today i sell all my xbox junk and become loyal to sony. But not before i repost thisceverywhere i can think. If your reading this dont trust xbox its a scam!

I know he read my chat question.Several more agents that says they can only check one, two, or three license keys per session (their story keeps changing).One agent that was totally clueless of the situation and ultimately wasted my time.One agent that finally checked my licenses (only three out of seven he could check), but looked like he was reading off of a script, rather than answering me directly.

Only to tag the call to developers.The fact is there are temporary and permanent solutions, but involve using Microsoft tools like wushowhide.diagcab or rolling sleeves and removing the drivers in question and removing folder permissions from the MS provided drivers so Windows cant access  the folder and thus cant downgrade drivers.The experts never tell you this they cant, because they are incompetent like the developers and techs working to develop Windows OS, so if you ever wonder why in particular Windows 10 has so many issues that go unfixed, look no further.For my money I would boycote their products and services, because money is the only language these Corps speak.",1,2017-03-30T02:41:06.000Z

Michaeljohn Keenan,Previously Stellar Company Now Beneath Contempt.,"I had a faulty 8 month old Surface Pro 4 replaced under the Advanced Exchange Scheme (Microsoft send a replacement together with a shipping label to return the faulty device and hold is made on my credit card during this process). I was sent a faulty replacement. Again I used the same procedure, this time a working replacement was sent and I returned the faulty machine. However, Microsoft charged me £850 for the replacement despite receiving the faulty Surface Pro 4.It has so far taken me over 10 hours of calls and online chat with no resolution in sight. I am still  £850 out of pocket and have in effect payed twice for a Surface Pro 4.It took me 4 days worth of phone calls over a period (including wait times) of 7.5 hours just to get the matter understood in the first place. I have since then spent 2,5 hours chasing up Microsoft to find out how my refund is progressing. This is despite Microsoft stating on 3 occasions that they will be in contact. They never call back. I always have to initiate further contact.I am sick of Microsoft's robotic niceties, their ""We care about you experience"", ""Have a nice day""; it is meaningless!This matter has affected not only my pocket but my health.I have been using Microsoft products since the 1980s and was always happy with their level of customer service, they were always a cut above the other tech companies in my experience.

Certain keys did not work (H, C, V, X) and the mouse intermittently would act as if you were holding down one of the buttons or a keyboard key.  (Trust me, it sounds simple enough, but until you have tried doing anything with a mouse that does weird things, you have no idea how frustrating it is).LASTLY - I noticed a couple of hours ago that files which I pay to store on Microsoft OneDrive were GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!These are models I PAID for, or CREATED.  I guess some were named incorrectly and this #@^% company thought they were copyrighted or infringed upon(???).  In any case, EVERYTHING relating to designer names (I had a Versace comforter for a game) was DELETED.  HUNDREDS of files .... GONE.Microsoft is GARBAGE, and OneDrive might be the worst, which is REALLY difficult seeing it has Windows 10 to go up against in terms of utter FAIL.Can someone PLEASE start a class action against them again?  One lady won 10k just because they upgraded her without permission.  What they are doing in terms of monopolizing the computers WE PAID for and deleting our things, or collecting our data, is way worse.Microsoft, as a whole, needs a good '@ss-whooping' and to give us all back a lot of money if, as the case seems, our computers belong to them and not us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,2018-11-30T01:51:13.000Z

Rita,Microsoft is rude,Microsoft has no customer service.  Mid October I set up Microsoft Live for my son and the set up resulted in being charged 5 times 59.95.  2 charges were refunded to me and I have called them multiple times to get the other 2 refunded.  Each person tells me something different and any steps they tell you to follow do not work.  As it stands for 1 year subscription initially cost me 299.75 but since they will not refund the other charges that are not valid I am paying 179.85.  I plan to pursue this through their corp offices.  Calling their toll free line is not getting this resolved.  Do everything you can to never use your personal cards if you decided to utilize their services.,1,2018-11-21T17:32:14.000Z
Bertrand,Xbox one analog joystick drift hidden defect,"After ordering a console plus controller, the controller failed after a bit more than one year. It seems that the xbox one controllers all fail quite consistently on the left analog joystick. As an electronics engineeer, I will obviously open up the controller and post a video on youtube of this hidden defect. Anyway, the Microsoft guy pretended that there was two years warranty on the console but only one on the controller. That is obviously not true, but today you have to accept that every customer representative is trained in illegal behavior, never admit to a violation of EU consumer law. Always the same thing, a consumer has no power at all when his rights are violated. Ryanair violating passenger rights? Warranty issues? You lose a lot of time chatting and calling (that is intentional so you give up) and you get arrogance by people that know they can do anything without risking anything. I supported xbox because competition against Sony and Nintendo is healthy but with this kind of support, they should go out of business.",1,2018-11-09T15:44:58.000Z

Paul C,Utter clowns,"Utter clowns.  Got a web alert email from Experian to tell me that they have found my Hotmail email address and password for sale on some website somewhere, so naturally my first step was to log into my Hotmail account and change my password, you'd think it would be easy enough.  First of all, forget trying phone them, you have to go through their just stupid virtual assistance support and pretty much impossible to phone a person direct.  Anyway if you go to change your password and your security details aren't up to date (like mine weren't) you have to change them.  So my account still had my old work email details as the security contact so I had to change this to my mobile number.  However, when you do that they then put your account on hold/closed until 30 days are up.  To unlock they ask you questions about emails you've just sent as well as other security questions, how am I supposed to give you details about what emails I sent if you've locked me out of my account????  As a result I failed my own security.  Such a farce of a recovery system, spent hours trying to get this resolved.  Stay away from them, wouldn't recommend.  Just want a simple call back (from a human not a bloody robot or anything) to sort this out and now, I'll be without my emails for days I bet.",1,2018-10-22T16:15:34.000Z

Desmond Last,This is my second new Microsoft Surface…,This is my second new Microsoft Surface Laptop. The first was replaced by Harvey Norman in Sydney because they agreed with me it had a fault. The fault is that my screen size zooms in and out as I type. Now my second Surface does the same - every-time I use it. Microsoft support were useless and never followed up. They expect me to buy a keyboard to test it. it is only 8-10 weeks old. I will never every again buy Microsoft. They are terrible at after sales and the computer is easily hacked - as I believe that to be the problem. Next time it will be an Apple.,1,2018-07-26T09:56:07.000Z
Jody Hanson,How Microsoft Makes Life Miserable,"An Open Letter to Satyan Nadella, CEO of MicrosoftDear Mr. Nadella,As the CEO of Microsoft, I think you should be aware of how your support staff deal with clients and how frustrating it is to try to recover an account because of a typo. As a writer/editor/on-line English teacher my world has come to a halt when my account was suspended.Tuesday 17 July 2018 started as a good day. Then I tried to renew my Office subscription -- it had expired while I was in the process of settling in Ecuador – and everything turned to confusion.After five days of unreturned phone calls, unanswered emails, and rejected account recovery forms I figured out the problem. My email can't be printed and somehow I managed to get a typo so that it read -- but can't be printed. So the correspondence from Microsoft went to that non-existent address.Since there is an option to fix the address I am obviously not the first – nor likely the last – to make that mistake. However, after too many attempts to count, the Microsoft “system” still wouldn’t accept the correction. Could you please have your technical people fix that problem?When I tried to get a call-back I was told my phone number didn’t exist. Live chat was a waste of time.The problem is that your front- line people can not do anything except babble the same jargon. I received a series of messages to a gmail account – in Spanish – telling me that my application didn’t meet the “requirements” – whatever they may be.One thing is that the credit union where I deal in Canada changed Mastercard companies in May, 2018. No, I do not have the old account number.Instead of going around and around in circles, why doesn’t Microsoft establish what they will accept as legitimate? How about a copy of my passport? A scan of my social security number? My maternal grandmother’s maiden name? These are tangible pieces of evidence – rather than the idiotic questions like “How much was your last Skype purchase?” Really, as though I would remember the exact amount and the precise date as it is an automatic deduction.I am writing to you with the hope that I can have my Microsoft account restored. Otherwise, Microsoft will litter my gmail-inbox with more messages – in Spanish --saying that I can’t prove I am the owner of this account.The case number is 143-359-1726, My telephone number is 593-999-69-08-77 and my email address can't be printed.I am in Ecuador with family and friends wondering why I haven’t called. Frustrating and totally unnecessary if Microsoft put a second level of “real” identification in place that could be dealt with in person, rather than another form letter. Some human interaction would go a long way to solving technical issues.Thank-you for your help.Sincerely,Jody Hanson, PhD",1,2018-07-21T23:24:37.000Z

(screen stuck on ""Choose your keyboard layout screen"")Day after day I've spend hours on the phone. Each day, a different person tells me a different thing.First, I was sent a media creation tool, which was supposed to fix it.When I called back to complete the process, I was told this would not work and they need to send out a technician. I was told to go get a cash card to pay the technician they will send out.Waiting around for the technician, I called to follow up.

Andre Reid,6 Surface Pro's Later...,"Over the last year I have Purchased and had to return over 6 Surface Pro's i7's including the new surface pro 5 to Microsoft after faults to do with screen ghosting, overheating, screen bleed and graphics bugs. I am completely distressed and have been reduced to using a £200 hp x2 whilst I look for an alternative.Utterly disappointed that a product which has cost me £100's in surface only peripherals has left me without a computer to use them with.As 3D Designer, working with 3D modelling, 2D art and photography, being able to utilise a flexible and premium system is what I need the most.The design of the product is great but the quality control is appauling!Since then, I have had numerous individuals and retailers advising me to go for apple products instead for their reliability.I personally want to upgrade to the surface book 2 which according to my research, is much more reliable due to the separation between graphics processing in the main unit.I no longer have my surface pro as I took it into and left it with PC world and was unable to find a suitable replacement.Please Microsoft help me. Is there anything you can do!?",2,2018-05-13T06:39:21.000Z
Alex Rossi,Surface Pro 4 flickering and Microsoft asking me to take more risks,"I have a Surface Pro 4. Microsoft has recognised they have a problem with this device model with screen flickering. Mine has that problem, of course happening after warranty expired.I called the customer care knowing the only way is to replace the unit for 333GBP.Knowing that the problem is not only on my unit, but in MANY Surface Pro 4 (there is even a website called flickergate.com)l, I asked the agent on the phone to agree on a like-to-like unit but Pro 2017 instead of Pro 4, as the replaced unit has got only 90 days warrranty and many people that accepted this arrangement got their new unit presenting the same problem (obviously after the 90 days) and lost other 333GBP.The customer care representitive said the only option is for the exact same model. I tried to explain that it doesn't make sense, I could get the same issue and Microsoft recognised that, but no result.After paying over 1000GBP for a Surface, then another 333GBP for a replacement due to a Microsoft issue, I still should be the one taking the risk in Microsoft opinion.Is that serious? Not only you don't do anything to fix YOUR issue, after I decide to even pay for a replacement unit you can't upgrade for a similar unit that at least doesn't present the problem?ABSURDEDIT: Yesterday 11th of May 2018, Microsoft recognised the issue with the Surface Pro 4 and is running a replacement program as a firmware fix hasn't been found. I applyed to that program and going to send my Surface to get a replacement back. Fingers crossed! If all goes good, I'll also think the review can go another star UP",4,2018-05-12T12:59:52.000Z
Just Me,The Microsoft Megacon!,"For a number of years, like many, I used Skype when it was, well, just Skype! Microsoft bought it, and that was the beginning of the end! Things changed, and all for the worse. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Skype AKA Microsoft are doing this, to adult users:''You need a parent's permission.Based on your age, we need your parent's permission before you can use this account. Using a web browser, sign in to account.microsoft.com to get your parent's permission and come back to try again''.The heavy handed stupidity then means, as with me, the adult cannot access their account, even if they have money credit. So, one then has to open a Microsoft Account, simply to contact Microsoft, and then they either ask you to adopt the child, even though I am not a child, and in adopting and verifying, they ask for PAYMENT! Yes, the parent, guardian or simply the person trying to get their adult account back up and running, is supposed to give back details or CC card details, and pay 50 pence, just to allow the account to go back to how it was, before Microsoft's thug policing interfered! They only offer an alternative which is to put through an ID request, So, I sent them my driver's licence, scanned. Two weeks ago! All I got back was some impersonal, dim-wit Microsoft email, asking for the ID, again, as they claimed it was not attached! So, this was sent, I emailed from both private email and said awful, new Microsoft account and guess what? Nothing! So, here we are, almost three weeks down the line, and Microsoft doing what it does best, which is interfere and bully, and do nothing! PLUS they wanted money, up front, from an adult, as they accused me of being a minor. The thing is, they are doing this to all non Microsoft members of Skype, and it is so transparent, as they almost force you into creating a new account with them! This is nothing to do with the various adult platforms dealing with underage threats or misuse, this is Microsoft flexing it's bullying muscles again and if you don't play ball, they block accounts, and do not deal with issues!This is why I dumped my Windows PC five years ago, and celebrated being free of the Microsoft and Windows grip! So, maybe I dump Skype> Maybe we should all dump both?!",1,2018-04-30T08:15:33.000Z

L.Radix,1 star? I wouldn't give them a condom in Africa!,"Let me tell you about my experience, which will illustrate Microsoft's lack of care, support and professionalism.Enjoy my suffering.I sent my Microsoft Surface Book to America from Japan (where I’m currently residing) on the recommendation of Microsoft online staff, as the staff could not repair the technical issues I was having. I was having issues with the hardware, nothing else. That's important to remember.I sent my laptop under the instruction of Microsoft to an address provided by Microsoft and insured my parcel with tracking to the cost of £50.My parcel was delivered to America on the 12th of January, but for two weeks Microsoft tracking showed that they did NOT have my laptop in their possession. I emailed countless times to find a resolve, but Microsoft staff consistently ignored my emails and had been reluctant to help me locate my parcel.After launching an investigation here in Japan with JP post, it was brought to my attention that Microsoft did indeed have my parcel, and it was in fact signed for by an agent to Microsoft on the 12th of January.With the knowledge that Microsoft had indeed had my laptop this entire time, I reached out again via email, but to no avail, I then made an attempt to publically 'call them out' via Instagram in hopes of getting their attention, to which they replied along the lines of, “message us through direct messaging and we’ll help you”, but again, I messaged them as they requested, forwarded all the relevant numbers and codes and even attached screen shots, and yet again, they too had not replied.I have opened Reddit forums, I have opened a Resolver case, I have messaged Microsoft employees on LinkedIn, and I have emailed countless times via the support website, but no one replies.I checked Microsoft tracking nearly two weeks later, and within 1 day, they received my parcel, repaired my laptop, dispatched my laptop to Japan and that I had received my laptop. I can confirm, categorically, that I DID NOT have my laptop.I once again emailed Microsoft but they did not reply.The member of Microsoft staff whom I’ve been in contact with, has been nothing but unhelpful, has consistently ignored my emails, and when he has responded, has replied with scripted and unrelated ‘text’.Suddenly, after being ignored for weeks, I received an email from Microsoft Japan on the 26th of January informing me that my laptop was being sent to them for repairs for a damaged screen. I never had a damaged screen.Most importantly, I was given a service request number by Microsoft prior to me sending my parcel to America. I have evidence of this. This is a key point.After two weeks or more of chasing Microsoft and having no help, it has been returned to me UNREPAIRED because as stated by Microsoft, ""There was no service request for this device""To sum up, I'm down £50 in postage fees, I still have a broken laptop, I still can't work, and Microsoft is ignoring me. I still have a year on my warranty.I need urgency from Microsoft because as a writer, I’m unemployed without a laptop. I am losing work, therefore, losing money. I have a backup laptop, which is a Microsoft surface too and that’s also broken.If you say Microsoft is great, you're lucky, lying, or in Microsoft's pocket.Microsoft?

Thirdy Birdy,"Good evening,","Good evening,I write with deep disappointed about my experience with Microsoft.I recently purchased surface pro 4 on the 22/09/2017 and received this on the 26th of September.I required this as I have recently started collage and needed something to be able to help me with my work.To my surprise my brand new surface pro decided to switch itself off and not turn back on again on the 27th of September.  While in class taking notes the surface pro began to heat up and decided to completely shut down and would not come back on. I decided to put it on charge thinking this would help.I have lost my work that I had completed on this and had to start again.The surface pro had completely let me down when I needed it.I contacted the customer service department on the 27th of September and was told to return it to them and they will refund this and I was told to buy a new one.Now to hear that was a complete shock as you expect something at £1651.31 and a brand so big and important like Microsoft to be reliable.I could not afford to buy another one and wait for a refund I needed the surface pro to help with collage.I was told I would have to return it to them and wait for delivery for a new one.So posted the surface pro back to Microsoft on the 28th of September. I couldn't believe it I had this for under 24 hours and was having to return it.I had to wait 7 days for a replacement.  To say I was angry was an understatement.I have always used Microsoft products and gadgets and never expected this and to be told to buy another or wait 7 days for a replacement.  I'm sorry but I do not have another £1651.31 to spend. I was offered no compensation for loss of my work and time I needed to have this to help with collage.I would like a reply to this within 30 days. If you require any further information please contact me.I feel that there could have been some sort of compensation for the poor customer service and the time wasted with delivery. There has been nothing and I will not be purchasing any further Microsoft products. I have completely lost all faith in the products.So far the replacement had been working. There is still an issue with it over heating but it hasn't switched off. Yet!I use surface pro approximately 6 hours per day. I feel this is nothing for such an expensive product.I look forward to your reply.RegardsSean Griffin",1,2017-11-03T21:43:17.000Z

So I get remote support. they check some drivers and run some diagnostics. fine fine, gotta cover the basics. then they go into msconfig, disable all my none MS start up services, and then switch boot mode to diagnostic. Well this mode does not load network drivers. Then they reboot my pc.Guess what? MS Logmein is gone.So I change back the settings and log back in with internet connected.
