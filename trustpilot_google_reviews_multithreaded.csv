Berlinerin,My Microsoft 365 1 user,"My Microsoft 365 1 user,  was renewed with an whopping $99.99  (instead of $ 69.99 annually)! WITHOUT my consent or agreement to do so!Customers service in India,  is a waste of Time,  calls are getting disconnected,  they are really not interested in helping any body!  What is with American based customer support? So be aware,  if you subscribe to the renewal online,  you will have nothing others than ""sorry""  and a lot of wasted time in phone calls,  with unqualified and ""but"" Indian bases customer service reps. Congratulations Microsoft any other business would be charged with ""FRAUD""!",1,2025-06-12T00:39:31.000Z
Bill,Microsoft locks me out of my hotmail…,"Microsoft locks me out of my hotmail accounts whenever I log in from an alternate device and/or location, has a flawed recovery system that locks you out of alternate email accounts on file to receive a code, and thus denies the customer from receiving vital MEDICAL, Business, Financial, and Social information. This becomes like a wrecking ball to a customer's career, emotions and even life in general. Even after I put in the correct username, password, captcha and puzzle solutions all immediately, Microsoft still doesn't believe it is me. I spoke to several reps by phone and got shocking responses about the ""process"" which is totally flawed and against the customer.Further - and this could be illegal - when Microsoft takes advertisers' money to reach target market customers, but does not allow the customers to access those ads, promotions, etc., then Microsoft OWES THOSE ADVERTISERS A REFUND!!! Microsoft also does not allow even its own supervisors to escalate very legitimate concerns such as these, and thus is dictatorial, disrespectful, and demeaning to its customers, advertisers and employees.I suggested several viable resolutions to the company and it politely refused. This ""extra security and protection"" on hotmail accounts should be an opt-in not a one-size-fits-all mandate with no opt-out potential.Government regulators overseeing the industry should investigate Microsoft's practices and behaviors up to and including redoing the hotmail policy, refunding advertisers monies, and stripping Microsoft of its license to operate. Class-action suits should be considered as well.Just look at all the complaints and pathetically low ratings online about this egregious behavior, how disgusting! Also, the company supervisor did not call me back for two scheduled calls (one finally did). Add arrogance to this complaint, too. Do not trust Microsoft or buy anything from it.",1,2025-06-11T21:30:46.000Z

Carlos Olivardia,The absolute worse customer service.,"Called business support and nobody can help you.  Their job is merely to take your information and forward you to the next queue that will no resolve issue and forward you to another queue.  Each person takes your contact information as if for the first time even though you have a ticket number. You bounce around the world repeating your phone number and email, restating every letter and restating your problem over and over again.  No help.  Your always told you'll be called back but that call never comes.  So you call back to no avail.",1,2025-06-06T03:44:02.000Z

Diane Paul,Appalling customer service,"Appalling customer service. Have gone round and round in circles for two days trying to sign in to the Teams site that have taken over from Skype who I have never had any problems with as it should be straightforward to log in. No way of changing my email address to my new one. I put my old email in, they refuse to accept my password. I ask for a code, it either doesn't arrive or when it does they reject it. Over and over. I look for the code, which means I leave the page to find their email and when I return, the page has disappeared and I have to begin again. And again...etc. I am absolutely appalled at their service and consequently I am not going to use Teams as I have found another way of reaching my students and it isn't Microsoft.

Marina Madzarevic,Worst support ever,"Worst support ever.I spent 2 hours in chat with an operator and a supervisor just to get an information about refund for the free trial.

My subscrption was cancel in time all was clear, but the refund didnt happend. Than I was told i dont have right on refund because I my subscription expired! Cancelled on time but I dont have right on it! If I cancel the subscription 3 days after activating it its IMPLICIT that i dont want to pay for it. Or there is no free trial or its a fraud.

TonyZ,Stop being greedy over Office update charges,"I appreciate that maintaining support for old systems is expensive. I have known about the need to update from Windows 10 to Windows 11 for some time, the update is free and I have update plans in place.I only recently heard of the need to update Office Home 2019. Investigating, it seems that the preferred route is subscription to Office 365 Home. The single purchase option only covers a single system, whereas my previous single purchase of Office covered at least 2 systems (which I need). I could find no discount offered for multiple purchases. I need security updates and bug fixes. I do not want or need new features provided by the subscription service.

He emailed back and confirmed 11th June that there was an error and he'd sort it out - he didn't I found that inexplicably the ticket had been closed. I contacted Malwarebytes again and a new ticket - 8032792 was issued by Willy Barba. I have had confirmation that there is an overpayment and despite a number of reminders this has still not been resolved.This is very simple problem. Is everybody on vacation over there.

Raymond Phillips,I have a problem with MicroSoft Outlook…,I have a problem with MicroSoft Outlook Sign-on Function this morning.  I spent hours online going in circles with the online support function.  I used a third party Geek Squad -- they were not successful and hinted at others having similar issues.  I reconnected with Microsoft Support the app sent me a link to a third party contractor who charges for their support just to find out that Outlook is having a major outage.  A reputable company is much more transparent about major outages -- transparency increases customer respect and reduces the calls and contacts that will overwhelm their support function.,1,2025-07-10T16:18:52.000Z

Every 2 weeks my Outlook stops functioning - I can't send or receive emails. I have completed request forms for assistance in the past and never received a reply. Today I decided to call and a (presumably AI generated) message informed me that the number couldn't be connected.

Craig Howat,Microsoft support is an oxymoron…,Microsoft support is an oxymoron because there's no support or help. Does anyone at Microsoft listen to their customers? I don't think they have a clue.

Sytse Kempenaar,"Hacked account, kept in database","Been a while now since my account was hacked with a security bypass by Russians, also thanks to G2A.com.When support was contacted and proven it's my account, all they had to say was: 'we know it's your account, but we can't help you.' Reason is that the email for security was changed. A friend's account on Roblox had the same: change in security email. Roblox however changed it to the email used for PayPal in previous payments.So i wonder if they're all just too dumb at Microsoft, or that the hacking was planned.This question also counts for the bypass used. Either Microsoft just let them hack or cooperate on the matter, or their security is simply that terrible that even Russia can get in with ease.",1,2025-08-18T10:01:39.000Z

Rita,Microsoft support falls short again,"I struggled with a maddening issue with Outlook 365 where my POP3 account with a new host kept reverting to the previous host’s IMAP settings in my main profile, managing several accounts with years of emails.Microsoft Support was a complete letdown. The agent stuck to basic troubleshooting I’d already exhausted, offering little insight beyond spotting a forgotten Exchange account from an old job. Microsoft’s solution? Create a new profile and export all 7 accounts’ data, a tedious workaround I rejected. When I called it what it was – a workaround – the agent got defensive. Frustrated, I wished them a nice evening and ended the call.Ironically, we found the fix in Microsoft’s own helpfiles: adding DisableOffice365SimplifiedAccountCreation to the registry. This resolved the issue instantly, no thanks to support.Microsoft support’s lack of depth and refusal to escalate forced us to solve it ourselves. Microsoft must empower their team to handle complex issues faster, especially for loyal users with multiple accounts.

Jon holmes,7 Days Without Resolution – Shocking Support from Microsoft,"I’m a small business owner, and Microsoft’s support has been nothing short of appalling.Over the past 7 days, I’ve been passed between multiple helpdesk agents, each telling me to raise yet another ticket with yet another team. No one takes ownership, and no progress is made. The situation remains unresolved and is directly affecting my business operations.I’ve asked repeatedly to escalate the issue. Still, no manager has contacted me, despite requesting urgent contact before 17:00 UK time. The process is disjointed, dismissive, and completely unfit for purpose—especially for business users who rely on Microsoft’s services.Microsoft, your systems have failed me. But worse than that, your support structure is broken. This has caused stress, lost productivity, and damage to my trust in your brand.If you’re a small business considering Microsoft—think twice.",1,2025-07-01T16:49:30.000Z
Tom V,Microsoft - a disgusting organisation,"I'm not one for the 'mental health' bandwagon, but Microsoft have serisously damaged my wellbeing.The most disgusting, profiteering, sneering, foul and ethically corrupt organisation I've ever had the misfortune to be involved with.

All they care about is their own bank balance.You'll get your karma.",1,2025-07-01T12:49:32.000Z
Robert William Platt,Used their support services to download…,"Used their support services to download a security update. They took control of my pc to execute same. The agent explained he needed to update Windows 11. However once the update completed I couldn’t access my pc !Contacted them on three separate occasions and post explaining the problem they cut the call, leaving me without my pc. Have again contacted them but no reply. I pay an annual subscription via MS 365 not for this awful service. My pc is only 5 months old and was circa £1000. No wonder they are losing hundreds of millions of customers",1,2025-06-30T18:23:03.000Z

Aaron Foster,Terrible service. Will be looking to delete my account and move over to a better service going forward.,For something as crucial as logging into my email account Microsoft offers absolutely no support.They don’t allow you to speak to a human. And once you’ve called them on a certain number they will block the menu option and auto hang up so you can’t get any support.

Debra Jewell,Microsoft is a P. O. S.,"I am so mad that I spent an hour with a CSA, trying to get help with being double charged, before I came over here to see the solid ""1"" for customer satisfaction scores.
